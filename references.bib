abstract = {For the purpose of sensitivity testing and illuminating nonconsensus components of time-dependent models, the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) has assembled a time-dependent version of its statewide probabilistic seismic hazard (PSH) model for California. The model incorporates available consensus information from within the earth-science community, except for a few faults or fault segments where consensus information is not available. For these latter faults, published information has been incorporated into the model. As in the 1996 CDMG/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) model, the time-dependent models incorporate three multisegment ruptures: a 1906, an 1857, and a southern San Andreas earthquake. Sensitivity tests are presented to show the effect on hazard and expected damage estimates of (1) intrinsic (aleatory) sigma, (2) multisegment (cascade) vs. independent segment (no cascade) ruptures, and (3) time-dependence vs. time-independence. Results indicate that (1) differences in hazard and expected damage estimates between time-dependent and independent models increase with decreasing intrinsic sigma, (2) differences in hazard and expected damage estimates between full cascading and not cascading are insensitive to intrinsic sigma, (3) differences in hazard increase with increasing return period (decreasing probability of occurrence), and (4) differences in moment-rate budgets increase with decreasing intrinsic sigma and with the degree of cascading, but are within the expected uncertainty in PSH time-dependent modeling and do not always significantly affect hazard and expected damage estimates.},

abstract = {The long recorded history of earthquakes in Japan affords an opportunity to forecast seismic shaking exclusively from past shaking. We calculate the time-averaged (Poisson) probability of severe shaking by using more than 10,000 intensity observations recorded since AD 1600 in a 350 km-wide box centered on Tokyo. Unlike other hazard-assessment methods, source and site effects are included without modeling, and we do not need to know the size or location of any earthquake nor the location and slip rate of any fault. The two key assumptions are that the slope of the observed frequency-intensity relation at every site is the same, and that the 400-year record is long enough to encompass the full range of seismic behavior. Tests we conduct here suggest that both assumptions are sound. The resulting 30-year probability of I-JMA {\textgreater}= 6 shaking (similar to PGA {\textgreater}= 0.4 g or MMI {\textgreater}= IX) is 30{\%}-40{\%} in Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama, and 10{\%}-15{\%} in Chiba and Tsukuba. This result means that there is a 30{\%} chance that 4 million people will be subjected to I-JMA {\textgreater}= 6 shaking during an average 30-year period. We also produce exceedance maps of PGA for building-code regulations, and calculate short-term hazard associated with a hypothetical catastrophe bond. Our results resemble an independent assessment developed from conventional seismic hazard analysis for greater Tokyo.},

abstract = {In Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis, which has become the basis of decision making on the design of high risk facilities, one estimates the probability that ground motion caused by earthquakes exceeds a certain level at a certain site within a certain time interval. One of the most critical aspects in this context is the model for the conditional probability of ground motion given earthquake magnitude, source-site-distance and potentially additional parameters. These models are usually regression functions, including terms modelling interaction effects derived from expert knowledge. We show that the framework of Directed Graphical Models is an attractive alternative to the standard regression approach. We investigate Bayesian Networks, modelling the problem in a true multivariate way, and we look into Naive Bayes and Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes, where the target node coincides with the dependent variable in standard ground motion regression. Our approach gives rise to distribution-free learning when necessary, and we experiment with and introduce different discretization schemes to apply standard learning and inference algorithms to our problem at hand. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The Chi-Chi earthquake occurred at 17:47 on 20 September 1999 and is the largest earthquake (M-W 7.6) to have occurred on land in Taiwan in the twentieth century. This earthquake caused considerable damage and was named the "921 Chi-Chi Great Earthquake" by the Taiwan government, as the local date was 21 September. Because an extensive strong-motion instrumentation program in Taiwan was completed by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) in 1996, over 30,000 digital strong-motion records have been obtained from the Chi-Chi earthquake and thousands of its aftershocks. These records form the largest set of strong-motion data recorded from a major earthquake since strong-motion seismology studies began in the 1930s. This data set is important to seismology and earthquake engineering because it includes over 60 recording sites within 20 km of the fault ruptures, which provides a five-fold increase of such near-field records available for the entire world. A prepublication CD was made available in mid-December 1999, and the data on it have been used by many authors in dozens of articles published so far. Since then, we examined about 10,000 strong-motion records and conducted a first-order quality assurance procedure for all the records obtained on 20 September 1999, including the mainshock and hundreds of the early aftershocks. We performed extensive data processing for quality assurance and selected a total of 663 strong-motion data files from 441 accelerographs to construct strong-motion records up to 4-min long for the mainshock whenever possible. In this article, we present a brief description of the processed acceleration data from the Chi-Chi earthquake. The data set (about 500 megabytes) and an extensive 562-page report (documenting the data processing and results of the processed data) are archived on the attached CD in this Special Issue so that users can quickly access this valuable data set for their research.},

abstract = {Spatial modeling of ground motion intensity measures (IMs) is required for risk assessment of spatially distributed engineering systems. For example, when a lifeline system is of concern, classical site-specific hazard tools, which treat IMs at different locations independently, may not be adequate to accurately assess the seismic risk. In fact, in this case, modeling of ground motion as a random field is required; it basically consists of assigning a correlation structure to the IM of interest. This work focuses on semiempirical estimation of the correlation coefficient, as a function of intersite separation distance, between residuals with respect to ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) of horizontal peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV). In particular, subsets of the European Strong-Motion Database (ESD) and the Italian Accelerometric Archive (ITACA) were employed to evaluate the intraevent residual correlation based on multiple earthquakes, considering different GMPEs fitted to the same records. The analyses were carried out through geostatistical tools, which enabled results to be found that are generally consistent between the two datasets. Correlation for PGV appears to attenuate more gradually with respect to PGA. In order to better understand the dependency of the results on the adopted estimation approach and dataset, some aspects related to the working hypotheses are critically discussed. Finally, estimated correlation models are used to develop illustrative applications of regional probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis.},

abstract = {On 23 October 1904, the area of the Oslofjord was struck by an MS 5.4 earthquake that was felt over much of northern Europe. We collected information available from seismological bulletins of the time and also seismogram copies from a number of seismic stations in Europe. This allowed, for the first time for this earthquake, an instrumental epicentral location, even if the observation capabilities at that time were poor due to low seismograph amplification and timing problems. After a careful selection and weighting of published onset times, the reported observations from the seismic stations in Uppsala, Hamburg, Potsdam, Gottingen, Leipzig, and Tartu could be used for this instrumental location of the event. We also performed an inversion of the available macroseismic observations, based on the kinematic function (KF) for the radiation of body waves from a line source. Because the problem is nonlinear and also bimodal for pure dip-slip mechanisms, we used a sharing niching genetic algorithm to perform the inversion. The new epicenter obtained from the KF intensity inversion is consistent with the new instrumental solution, giving a location in the lower crust (25-30 km) and close to the eastern coast of the Oslofjord, near the junction of two major fault zones. The KF inversion was moreover able to constrain the fault-plane mechanism with an almost vertical rupture plane striking north-northeast-south-southwest (206{\{}degrees{\}}-212{\{}degrees{\}}) with a mixed mechanism (approximately 64{\{}degrees{\}} rake angle), the ambiguity of which is resolved by the polarities of the Pn onset observed on the horizontal components of the Uppsala Wiechert seismograph. The magnitude of the event has previously been assessed to MS 5.4, based on the size of the felt area observations, and a value of MS[{\~{}}]5.4 has now been independently confirmed both through the new intensity inversion and through the instrumental data.

abstract = {Large research initiatives such as the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) or the Seismic HAzard haRmonization in Europe (SHARE) projects concentrate a great collaborative effort on defining a global standard for seismic hazard estimations. In this context, there is an increasing need for identifying ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) that can be applied at both global and regional scale. With increasing amounts of strong-motion records that are now available worldwide, observational data can provide a valuable resource to tackle this question. Using the global dataset of Allen and Wald (2009), we evaluate the ability of 11 GMPEs to predict ground-motion in different active shallow crustal regions worldwide. Adopting the approach of Scherbaum et al. (2009), we rank these GMPEs according to their likelihood of having generated the data. In particular, we estimate how strongly data support or reject the models with respect to the state of noninformativeness defined by a uniform weighting. Such rankings derived from this particular global dataset enable us to explore the potential of GMPEs to predict ground motions in their host region and also in other regions depending on the magnitude and distance considered. In the ranking process, we particularly focus on the influence of the distribution of the testing dataset compared with the GMPE's native dataset. One of the results of this study is that some nonindigenous models present a high degree of consistency with the data from a target region. Two models in particular demonstrated a strong power of geographically wide applicability in different geographic regions with respect to the testing dataset: the models of Akkar and Bommer (2010) and Chiou et al. (2010).},

Efficient discretization of continuous attributes is an important problem that has effects on speed, accuracy and understandability of the induction models. In this paper, we propose a new discretization method MODL1, founded on a Bayesian approach. We introduce a space of discretization models and a prior distribution defined on this model space. This results in the definition of a Bayes optimal evaluation criterion of discretizations. We then propose a new super-linear optimization algorithm that manages to find near-optimal discretizations. Extensive comparative experiments both on real and synthetic data demonstrate the high inductive performances obtained by the new discretization method.},

@article{Goda2009a,
abstract = {The conventional approach for developing empirical prediction equations of multivariate ground-motion parameters (e.g., response spectra at a set of vibration periods) is based on regression analysis of the individual parameters; their dependence is subsequently characterized by evaluating the linear correlation coefficient of the logarithm of the ground-motion parameters that are corrected by using a ground-motion prediction equation. A copula technique, which offers a flexible way of describing nonlinear dependence among multivariate data in isolation from their marginal distribution functions, can be used to validate this two-step approach. This new perspective on the multivariate aspects of the development of ground-motion prediction equations is explored through analysis of the strong ground-motion data associated with the Boore and Atkinson (2008) Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research-Next Generation Attenuation of Ground Motions (PEER-NGA) relation. The analysis results demonstrate that multivariate ground-motion parameters can be marginally modeled as a lognormal variate, and their interperiod dependence can be captured by using the normal copula. This finding validates the conventional two-step approach.},

abstract = {This manuscript reports ground motion intensity measure (IM) correlations for a number of IM types, as measured from the NGA-West2 database. IMs considered are Spectral Accelerations with periods from 0.01s to 10s, Peak Ground Acceleration, Peak Ground Velocity, and Significant Duration (for 5-75{\%} and 5-95{\%} definitions). Results are shown for correlations of both maximum- direction and geometric mean spectral acceleration values, given the need for such maximum-direction correlations in a new ASCE 7-16 procedure. Additionally, the potential magnitude-, distance- and site-condition-dependence of IM correlations are evaluated. The results are practically important as IM correlations are increasingly used in a range of engineering and seismic hazard calculations. We find that maximum-direction spectral correlations are comparable to correlations for other spectral acceleration definitions, and that the correlations have no practically significant dependence on magnitude, distance or site conditions. These results support the collective understanding that IM correlations are stable across a range of conditions, and as a result, that existing correlation models are generally appropriate for continued use in engineering calculations.},

@article{Harmsen2008,
abstract = {Models of the Santa Clara Valley (SCV) 3D velocity structure and 3D finite-difference software are used to predict ground motions from scenario earthquakes on the San Andreas (SAF), Monte Vista/Shannon, South Hayward, and Calaveras faults. Twenty different scenario ruptures are considered that explore different source models with alternative hypocenters, fault dimensions, and rupture velocities and three different velocity models. Ground motion from the full wave field up to 1 Hz is exhibited as maps of peak horizontal velocity and pseudospectral acceleration at periods of 1, 3, and 5 sec. Basin edge effects and amplification in sedimentary basins of the SCV are observed that exhibit effects from shallow sediments with relatively low shear-wave velocity (330 m/sec). Scenario earthquakes have been simulated for events with the following magnitudes: (1) M 6.8-7.4 Calaveras sources, (2) M 6.7-6.9 South Hayward sources, (3) M 6.7 Monte Vista/Shannon sources, and (4) M 7.1-7.2 Peninsula segment of the SAF sources. Ground motions are strongly influenced by source parameters such as rupture velocity, rise time, maximum depth of rupture, hypocenter, and source directivity. Cenozoic basins also exert a strong influence on ground motion. For example, the Evergreen Basin on the northeastern side of the SCV is especially responsive to 3-5-sec energy from most scenario earthquakes. The Cupertino Basin on the southwestern edge of the SCV tends to be highly excited by many Peninsula and Monte Vista fault scenarios. Sites over the interior of the Evergreen Basin can have long-duration coda that reflect the trapping of seismic energy within this basin. Plausible scenarios produce predominantly 5-sec wave trains with greater than 30 cm/sec sustained ground-motion amplitude with greater than 30 sec duration within the Evergreen Basin.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a nonparametric multivariate spatial model that avoids specifying a Gaussian distribution for spatial random effects. Our nonparametric model extends the stick-breaking (SB) prior of Sethuraman (1994), which is frequently used in Bayesian modelling to capture uncertainty in the parametric form of an outcome. The stick-breaking prior is extended here to the spatial setting by assigning each location a different, unknown distribution, and smoothing the distributions in space with a series of space-dependent kernel functions that have a space-varying bandwidth parameter. This results in a flexible non-stationary spatial model, as different kernel functions lead to different relationships between the distributions at nearby locations. This approach is the first to allow both the probabilities and the point mass values of the SB prior to depend on space. Thus, there is no need for replications and we obtain a continuous process in the limit. We extend the model to the multivariate setting by having for each process a different kernel function, but sharing the location of the kernel knots across the different processes. The resulting covariance for the multivariate process is in general nonstationary and nonseparable. The modelling framework proposed here is also computationally efficient because it avoids inverting large matrices and calculating determinants, which often hinders the spatial analysis of large data sets. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed multivariate spatial process. The methods are illustrated using simulated examples and an air pollution application to model components of fine particulate matter.},

abstract = {We analyze high dynamic range waveform spectra to determine t* values for both P and S waves from earthquakes in southern California. We invert the t* values for three-dimensional (3-D) frequency-independent Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nregional models of the crust. The models have 15 km horizontal grid spacing and an average vertical grid spacing of 4 km, down to 22 km depth, and extend from the U.S.-Mexico border to the Coast Ranges in the south and Sierra Nevada in the north. In general, Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nincrease rapidly with depth, consistent with crustal densities and velocities. The 3-D Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nmodels image the major tectonic structures and to a much lesser extent the thermal structure of the southern California crust. The near-surface low Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nzones coincide with major sedimentary basins such as the San Bernardino, Chino, San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Maria basins and the Salton Trough. In contrast, at shallow depths beneath the Peninsular Ranges, southern Mojave Desert, and southern Sierras, we image high Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nzones, which correspond to the dense and high-velocity rocks of the mountain ranges. Several clear transition zones of rapidly varying Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$ncoincide with major late Quaternary faults and connect regions of high and low Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n. At midcrustal depths, the Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nexhibit modest variation in slightly higher and lower Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nor Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nzones, which is consistent with reported crustal reflectivity. In general, for the southern California crust, Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n/Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nis greater than 1.0, suggesting partially fluid-saturated crust. A few limited regions of Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n/Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nless than 1.0 correspond to areas mostly outside the major sedimentary basins, including areas around the San Jacinto fault, suggesting a larger reduction in the shear modulus compared to the bulk modulus or almost complete fluid saturation.},

abstract = {Subpixel correlation of preevent and postevent air photos reveal the complete near-field, horizontal surface deformation patterns of the 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers and 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine ruptures. Total surface displacement values for both earthquakes are systematically larger than “on-fault” displacements from geologic field surveys, indicating significant distributed, inelastic deformation occurred along these ruptures. Comparison of these two data sets shows that 46 ± 10{\%} and 39 ± 22{\%} of the total surface deformation were distributed over fault zones averaging 154 m and 121 m in width for the Landers and Hector Mine events, respectively. Spatial variations of distributed deformation along both ruptures show correlations with the type of near-surface lithology and degree of fault complexity; larger amounts of distributed shear occur where the rupture propagated through loose unconsolidated sediments and areas of more complex fault structure. These results have basic implications for geologic-geodetic rate comparisons and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.},

abstract = {The seismic ground motion hazard is assessed for a 10{\%} probability of exceedance in 50 years for the three counties (Los Angeles, Ventura, and Orange) impacted by the 1994 Northridge earthquake (Mw 6.7). The earthquake source model of the Southern California Earthquake Center has been modified with additional slip-rate information for mapped faults and blind thrusts and incorporated into seismic hazard maps that will be used for making regional hazard and risk mitigation decisions by state and local government agencies. Peak horizontal ground acceleration (pga) and 5{\%} damped spectral acceleration (SA) (0.3 and 1 sec) were calculated with three equally weighted attenuation relationships of Boore et al. (1993), Campbell and Bozorgnia (1994), and Sadigh (written comm., 1994). The results of this assessment indicate high hazard over the entire tri-county area with ground motions exceeding 0.4 g (pga), 1.0 g (0.3-sec SA), and 0.5 g (1-sec SA) nearly everywhere. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is described for two sites located in Los Angeles and Northridge. This analysis yields 95{\%} confidence limits for peak ground acceleration at the two sites that range between {\{}+/-{\}}0.1 and {\{}+/-{\}}0.2 g. Our calculations indicate that the uncertainty in the magnitude-rupture length relations, magnitude distribution, moment-magnitude relation, attenuation relation, and slip-rate contribute most to the hazard uncertainty at these sites and that the highest uncertainties in the mapped ground motion are associated with the strongest anticipated ground motions.},

abstract = {Ground motions of the South Napa earthquake (24 August 2014; M 6.0) were recorded at 19 stations within 20 km and 292 stations within 100 km of the rupture surface trace, generating peak ground motions in excess of 50{\%}g and 50 cm/s in and near Napa Valley. This large dataset allows us to compare the ground motion from the earthquake to existing ground‐motion prediction equations (GMPEs) in considerable detail. Using the ground‐motion data compiled and reported by ShakeMap (Wald et al., 2000), we examine the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV), as well as the pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) at periods of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 s. At the higher frequencies, especially PGA, data recorded at close distances (within ∼20 km) are very consistent with the GMPEs, implying a stress drop for this event similar to the median for California, that is, 5 MPa (Baltay and Hanks, 2014). At all frequencies, the attenuation with distance is stronger than the GMPEs would predict, which suggests the attenuation in the Napa and San Francisco Bay delta region is stronger than the average attenuation in California. The spatial plot of the ground‐motion residuals is positive to the north, in both Napa and Sonoma Valleys, consistent with increases in amplitude expected from both the directivity and basin effects. More interestingly, perhaps, there is strong ground motion to the south in the along‐strike direction, particularly for PSA at 1.0 s. These strongly positive residuals align with an older, Quaternary fault structure associated with the Franklin or Southampton fault, potentially indicating a fault‐zone‐guided wave.},

Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches, especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new concept for constructing prior distributions. We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

@article{TianqingCao02012007,
abstract = {Disaggregation of seismic hazard provides the relative contributions to hazards from sources of different magnitude, distance, and epsilon. It is extended in this study to the disaggregation of annualized loss ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the average total annual value loss of an ensemble of properties to the total original value of those properties. Seismic hazard is usually disaggregated with a given ground-motion value at a spectral frequency or with ground-motion values of certain mean return period and spectral frequency. Hence, the results of seismic-hazard disaggregation depend on the given ground motion. The results are very useful for engineers to select a single "design earthquake." However, as shown herein, if the seismic sources have recurrence times very different from the mean return period of the given ground motions, their relative contributions are suppressed and may be missed completely. For some applications, such as in the residential home insurance industry, this is not desirable. The annualized loss ratio disaggregation is performed using the whole hazard curve together with the building-response curve. It does not have the limitations of being dependent on the given ground motion and may be more appropriate for some applications such as home insurance. Seismic-hazard disaggregation may be extended not only to annualized loss ratio, which is the result of the structural vulnerability exposed to hazard, but also to the measures of loss due to other hazards like liquefaction and landslide as well. Specially designed measures for losses of these hazards, similar to the annualized loss ratio for disaggregation, are needed.

abstract = {Fragility curves are commonly used in civil engineering to estimate the vulnerability of structures to earthquakes. The probability of failure associated with a failure criterion (e.g. the maximal inter-storey drift ratio being greater than a prescribed threshold) is represented as a function of the intensity of the earthquake ground motion (e.g. peak ground acceleration or spectral acceleration). The classical approach consists in assuming a lognormal shape of the fragility curves. In this paper, we introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves without making any assumption, namely the conditional Monte Carlo simulation and the kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility curves of a 3-storey steel structure, accounting for the nonlinear behavior of the system. The curves obtained by the proposed approaches are compared with each other and with those obtained using the classical lognormal assumption.},

Systems which display a measurable degree of disorder can be studied efficiently using a probabilistic approach. Different scenarios can be randomly generated with the SFEM to study the behaviour of systems that take into account prior knowledge of the differing variations in properties. This review paper introduces the most commonly used techniques: direct Monte Carlo simulation, the perturbation method and the spectral stochastic finite element method. It then looks at the currently available software for the SFEM and provides examples from the disciplines of materials science, biomechanics and engineering to illustrate different procedures by which the SFEM is practically used. The aim of the paper is to help scientists and engineers quickly assess how they might apply SFEM to their own research and guide them towards key publications.},

abstract = {Seismic shear-wave velocity as a function of depth for generic rock sites has been estimated from borehole data and studies of crustal velocities, and these velocities have been used to compute frequency-dependent amplifications for zero attenuation for use in simulations of strong ground motion. We define a generic rock site as one whose velocity at shallow depths equals the average of those from the rock sites sampled by the borehole data. Most of the boreholes are in populated areas; for that reason, the rock sites sampled are of particular engineering significance. We consider two generic rock sites: rock, corresponding to the bulk of the borehole data, and very hard rock, such as is found in glaciated regions in large areas of eastern North America or in portions of western North America. The amplifications on rock sites can be in excess of 3.5 at high frequencies, in contrast to the amplifications of less than 1.2 on very hard rock sites. The consideration of unattenuated amplification alone is computationally convenient, but what matters for ground-motion estimation is the combined effect of amplification and attenuation. For reasonable values of the attenuation parameter $\kappa$0, the combined effect of attenuation and amplification for rock sites peaks between about 2 and 5 Hz with a maximum level of less than 1.8. The combined effect is about a factor of 1.5 at 1 Hz and is less than unity for frequencies in the range of 10 to 20 Hz (depending on $\kappa$0). Using these amplifications, we find provisional values of about $\Delta$$\sigma$ = 70 bars and $\kappa$0 = 0.035 sec for rock sites in western North America by fitting our empirically determined response spectra for an M 6.5 event to simulated values. The borehole data yield shear velocities (V̅30) of 618 and 306 m/sec for “rock” and “soil” sites, respectively, when averaged over the upper 30 m. From this, we recommend that V̅30 equals 620 and 310 m/sec for applications requiring the average velocity for rock and soil sites in western North America. By combining the amplifications for rock sites and the site factors obtained from our analysis of strong-motion data, we derive amplifications for sites with V̅30 = 520 m/sec (NEHRP class C, corresponding to a mix of rock and soil sites) and V̅30 = 310 and 255 m/sec (average soil and NEHRP class D sites, respectively). For the average soil site, the combined effect of amplification and attenuation exceeds a factor of 2.0 for frequencies between 0.4 and about 4 Hz, with a peak site effect of 2.4; the peak of the NEHRP class D site effect is 2.7.},

abstract = {The main goal of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is to calculate the probability of exceedance for a range of shaking levels at a particular site. This requires the use of calculating the conditional probability of a ground motion intensity parameter of engineering interest given some earthquake and site related parameters such as magnitude, distance or Vs30. For that purpose, usually empirical regression models are employed, which are referred to as Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs). Some problems in this context relate to the functional form of the GMPE and the choice of predictor variables that are assumed to affect the ground motion distribution. Here we address these issues by adhering to the multivariate statistical framework Bayesian Networks (BNs). We investigate the use of Bayesian Networks in PSHA in general, and illustrate the applicability and advantages of employing BNs in the ground motion domain. Our departure point is motivated by the desire to learn from data, inother words, we take a data-driven stance and learn a Bayesian Network from a strong motion dataset consisting of several earthquake, site and ground motion parameters. By analyzing and inspecting the resulting BN this approach allows us to assess the actual probabilistic (in)dependencies that hold between these parameters as supported by the data. We also derive Bayesian networks using "classical" GMPEs. The Bayesian networks for the ground motion domain are extended based on a priori domain knowledge: we incorporate other variables, parameters and relate them in a way that we deem appropriate and relevant for PSHA. Thus, we arrive at a full-fledged multivariate statistical model of PSHA in terms of a Bayesian network. Since Bayesian networks provide a principled framework for reasoning (by way of statistical inference) under uncertainty, this offers the possibility to incorporate various sources of uncertainty and variability that prevail in PSHA into a single network. From this network, we can now easily compute e.g. the conditional distribution of the ground motion parameter of interest given different sets of evidence for the earthquake and site parameters. Hence, we can use the PSHA-Bayesian network to easily investigate the PSHA results with regard to uncertainties of different variables that are important for PSHA, and we can examine the influence of several earthquake and site related parameters on the hazard curve. The use of Bayesian networks for PSHA also offers new perspectives for evaluating/ disaggregating the results of a hazard study, since it is possible to compute any marginal or conditional distribution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {We produce probabilistic seismic-hazard assessments for the central Apennines, Italy, using time-dependent models that are characterized using a Brownian passage time recurrence model. Using aperiodicity parameters,{\{}alpha{\}} of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, we examine the sensitivity of the probabilistic ground motion and its deaggregation to these parameters. For the seismic source model we incorporate both smoothed historical seismicity over the area and geological information on faults. We use the maximum magnitude model for the fault sources together with a uniform probability of rupture along the fault (floating fault model) to model fictitious faults to account for earthquakes that cannot be correlated with known geologic structural segmentation. We show maps for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 1.0 Hz spectral acceleration (SA1) on rock having 10{\%} probability of exceedence in 50 yr. We produce maps to compare the separate contributions of smoothed seismicity and fault components. In addition we construct maps that show sensitivity of the hazard for different{\{}alpha{\}} parameters and the Poisson model. For the Poisson model the addition of fault sources to the smoothed seismicity raises the hazard by 50{\%} at locations where the smoothed seismicity contributes the highest hazard and up to 100{\%} at locations where the hazard from smoothed seismicity is low. For the strongest aperiodicity parameter (smallest{\{}alpha{\}} ), the hazard may further increase 60{\%}-80{\%} or more or may decrease by as much as 20{\%} depending on the recency of the last event on the fault that dominates the hazard at a given site. In order to present the most likely earthquake magnitude and/or the most likely source-site distance for scenario studies, we deaggregate the seismic hazard for SA1 and PGA for two important cities (Rome and L'Aquila). For PGA both locations show the predominance of local sources having magnitudes of about 5.3 and 6.5, respectively. For SA1 at a site in Rome, there is significant contribution from local smoothed seismicity and an additional contribution from the more distant Apennine faults having magnitude around 6.8. For L'Aquila the predominant sources remain local. In order to show the variety of impact of different{\{}alpha{\}} values, we also obtained deaggregations for another three sites. In general, as{\{}alpha{\}} decreases (periodicity increases), the deaggregation indicates that the hazard is highest near faults with the highest earthquakes rates. This effect is strongest for the long-period (1 sec) ground motions.

abstract = {This article describes an application of nonparametric local linear regression to study the spatial structure of the mean trend of earthquake magnitudes. If spatial correlation is suspected in a data set of earthquakes in a particular geographic area, the smoothing parameter needed to obtain the estimator of the mean magnitude will be computed using a corrected version of a generalized cross-validation method. This procedure allows us to take the spatial dependence into account to obtain better smoothing parameters. Additionally, a parametric bootstrap technique is used to quantify the variability of the spatial maps produced with the nonparametric estimation method and to compute the probability of observing a magnitude larger than or equal to a given threshold for an earthquake occurring in a specific epicenter. These techniques are applied to two different earthquake data sets: the historic catalog of the northwest Iberian Peninsula and the earthquakes in California from January 1998 to April 2008.},

abstract = {We performed stochastic finite-fault simulations for the moment magnitude (M) 9.0 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake at KiK-net sites using the EXSIM algorithm (Motazedian and Atkinson, 2005; Atkinson et al., 2009; Boore, 2009). The average response spectra of the simulated ground motions were calculated and compared with observed ground motions to determine whether stochastic finite-fault modeling can reproduce key features of the recorded motions. To account for variations in source characteristics, we examined three rupture-process models: a single-event model with random slip distribution, a single-event model with prescribed slip distribution (Yagi, 2011; see Data and Resources), and a multiple-event model with five strong-motion generation areas (Kurahashi and Irikura, 2011). The analysis results indicate that the single-event models can model the highfrequency response spectra values well but result in significant model bias in the low-frequency range. By contrast, the multiple-event model produces ground motions that are in good agreement with the observations in both high- and low-frequency ranges. Furthermore, the multiple-event model can capture temporal characteristics of observed ground motions, including multiphase arrivals of major seismic-wave groups. Importantly, the calibrated EXSIM model for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake can be used to produce predicted ground motions in other regions, such as the Cascadia subduction region of North America, by suitable modifications of regional attenuation and site parameters. The suitability of the simple stochastic simulation method to prediction of motions for future events, the details of which are poorly known, makes its calibration to Tohoku a useful exercise.},

The objective of the NGA program is to derive such estimates for periods ranging from 0.01 to 10 seconds. At this time, however, only estimates for pga and for the periods listed above are included in this edition of the Volume.

abstract = {The New Madrid seismic zone is the most important regional seismic hazard in middle America, having produced several very large earthquakes in historic and geologic time. In this study we simulate time histories in Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri, for M 7.5 and M 8.0 earthquakes along two faults in the New Madrid seismic zone. Simulations are based on a well-established and calibrated finite-fault simulation program (FINSIM), which has been shown to reproduce ground motions for earthquakes of M 4-8 in eastern and western North America (Beresnev and Atkinson, 2001a). Simulations are made for representative soil profiles for each city, as well as for reference bedrock conditions (at the base of the soil profile); the effect of nonlinearity on soil amplification is considered for the soil sites. Uncertainty in the results is considered by modeling a wide range of alternative scenarios, representing the major uncertainties in input parameters. The total uncertainty in ground motions (response spectra) is about a factor of 2. Results are most sensitive to magnitude, hypocenter location (directivity effects), and maximum slip velocity. The resulting time histories and spectra for all modeled scenarios are available as an electronic supplement to this article.  Results are validated to the extent possible using the modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) observations from the 1811-1812 earthquakes. The simulated motions are consistent with MMI observations at St. Louis and Memphis. It is not possible to distinguish, based on the MMI observations, which of the M 7.5 or M 8.0 scenarios are most likely. However, we conclude that the most extreme scenarios, such as M 8.0 with high slip velocity or large directivity effects, are not likely because they would produce higher MMI values than those that were observed.

abstract = {The deaggregation of seismic hazard is an effective way to identify  scenario events that contribute to a selected seismic-hazard level. Depending on the use of the deaggregation results, the contribution may be defined as equal to or exceeding the selected hazard level. The deaggregation of seismic hazard should consider all uncertainty, aleatory uncertainty, and epistemic uncertainty. The identified scenario events can be used to check the responses of structures such as buildings. However, structures are constructed to provide service rather than just sustain environmental disturbances, and the seismic-risk assessment is at least as important and valuable as the seismic-hazard assessment for emergency preparedness planning  and for the financial industry. Therefore, the notion of the deaggregation of seismic hazard is extended to that of seismic risk in the present study. Other issues investigated in this study are the impact of approximate treatment of epistemic uncertainty  and the Cascadia subduction events on the deaggregation, and the differences in the identified scenario events from the deaggregation of seismic hazard and seismic risk.  Numerical results suggest that the contribution of the uncertainty in attenuation relations to the deaggregation results can be very significant, and that the identified scenario events by deaggregating seismic hazard and seismic risk are somewhat different. Also, the elapsed time since the last major event for source zones whose earthquake occurrence is modeled as a renewal process can affect the deaggregation results significantly.},

@article{Langston1977,
abstract = {A geometrical ray method is developed for wave calculations involving three- dimensional planar dipping interfaces. Justification for the method is based on analogy with first-motion approximations derived from generalized ray theory where frequency dependence in the reflection-transmission coefficients is related to changes in the complex ray parameter. The method is applied to finding the teleseismic response of an arbitrarily oriented dislocation source in dipping layered media and for receiver calculations which assume an impinging P or S wave be- neath a stack of dipping layers. Source results indicate that wave forms from fast azimuthally varying sources, such as strike-slip faults, are significantly dis- torted from the plane layered case for simple structures. A simple dipping Moho for dips up to 10 ° does not significantly distort vertical and radial P waves for the receiver response. However, due to azimuth anomalies introduced by inter- face dip a significant tangential P component is produced. In addition, the S-wave response becomes a function of source mechanism due to the need for specifying the incident polarization angle. Polarization studies are suggested for finding dipping structure. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Seismic qualification by test is widely used as a way to show the integrity and functionality of equipment that is related to the overall safety of nuclear power plants. Another means of seismic qualification is by direct integration analysis. Both approaches require a series of time histories as an input. However, in most cases, the possibility of using real earthquake data is limited. Thus, artificial time histories are widely used instead. In many cases, however, response spectra are given. Thus, most of the artificial time histories are generated from the given response spectra. Obtaining the response spectrum from a given time history is straightforward. However, the procedure for generating artificial time histories from a given response spectrum is difficult and complex to understand. Thus, this paper presents a simple time-domain method for generating a time history from a given response spectrum; the method was shown to satisfy conditions derived from nuclear regulatory guidance.},

However, there are many examples of the use of PGV in engineering seismology and earthquake engineering, including as a parameter from which to estimate macroseismic intensity and structural damage. PGV is also employed in some methods for the assessment of liquefaction potential and, because of its relationship to ground strains, in the seismic design and assessment of buried pipelines. One of the most important uses of PGV has been in the construction of elastic response spectra. There are relatively few predictive equations for PGV, compared to those for PGA and spectral ordinates, but 25 such equations are reviewed and summarised. The issue of scaling PGV from response spectral ordinates is explored and it is shown that the common practice of scaling PGV from spectral accelerations at 1.0 second should not be continued because the ratio of the two quantities is highly variable. A more stable relationship exists between PGV and the spectral acceleration at 0.5 second response period; however, it is clearly preferable to estimate peak velocities directly and PGV equations should be derived together with equations for spectral ordinates in the same way as PGA.},

abstract = {Conventional probabilistic seismic-hazard assessment (PSHA) is difficult to apply in regions lacking sufficient information concerning geological setting, active faults, and so forth. Also, for a site-specific PSHA, site effects arising from both crustal rock and overlying soil sediments are generally not assessed rigorously. This is of particular importance for those metropolitan cities having a significant proportion of reclaimed land, because the site-to-site variability of such site effects can be very large. The objective of this article is to demonstrate an alternative procedure for assessing seismic hazard, developed from the conventional source-based Cornell-McGuire PSHA approach, based on considering an infinite number of sources. The proposed new procedure is termed the direct amplitude-based (DAB) approach. The major advantage of the proposed DAB approach is that it is not necessary to characterize any seismic sources. Moreover, if a "site-specific" and "event- specific" ground-motion attenuation model is available, a more accurate site-specific PSHA could be performed. Also, a generic analytical solution for the proposed procedure has been derived to avoid the need for a lengthy integration process. Using the proposed approach, peak ground velocities have been computed at different return periods, to form a seismic hazard curve, citing Hong Kong as a case study.

@article{Petersen2011,
abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology, data, and regression equations for calculating the fault rupture hazard at sites near steeply dipping, strike-slip faults. We collected and digitized on-fault and off-fault displacement data for 9 global strikeslip earthquakes ranging from moment magnitude M 6.5 to M 7.6 and supplemented these with displacements from 13 global earthquakes compiled byWesnousky (2008), who considers events up to M 7.9. Displacements on the primary fault fall off at the rupture ends and are often measured in meters, while displacements on secondary (offfault) or distributed faults may measure a few centimeters up to more than a meter and decay with distance from the rupture. Probability of earthquake rupture is less than 15{\%} for cells 200 m×200 m and is less than 2{\%} for 25 m×25 m cells at distances greater than 200mfrom the primary-fault rupture. Therefore, the hazard for off-fault ruptures is much lower than the hazard near the fault. Our data indicate that rupture displacements up to 35cm can be triggered on adjacent faults at distances out to 10kmor more from the primary-fault rupture. An example calculation shows that, for an active fault which has repeated large earthquakes every few hundred years, fault rupture hazard analysis should be an important consideration in the design of structures or lifelines that are located near the principal fault, within about 150 m of well-mapped active faults with a simple trace and within 300 m of faults with poorly defined or complex traces.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Seismological Society of America. All rights reserved. This article presents the development of ground-motion prediction equations for the maximum rotated (RotD100) horizontal component of five intensity measures: Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, cumulative absolute velocity above the 5 cm/s 2 threshold (CAV 5 ), standardized cumulative absolute velocity (CAV STD ), and peak incremental ground velocity. The equations predict the ground-motion intensity at outcropping rock sites. This scope reflects the critical importance of outcropping rock-motion properties that can be employed as predictors of certain site-response quantities or used as input to site-response and soil–structure interaction analyses. We present equations for the shallow crustal, intraplate, and subduction tectonic environments and between- and within-event standard deviations for each. We also provide supplemental logistic models predicting the probability that CAV 5 and CAV STD exceed zero in a given earthquake scenario. These equations are valid for magnitudes between 4.0 and 9.0 and source-to-site distances up to 400 km, depending on the tectonic environment.},

abstract = {In many applications, the objective is to build regression models to explain a response variable over a region of interest under the assumption that the responses are spatially correlated. In nearly all of this work, the regression coefficients are assumed to be constant over the region. However, in some applications, coefficients are expected to vary at the local or subregional level. Here we focus on the local case. Although parametric modeling of the spatial surface for the coefficient is possible, here we argue that it is more natural and flexible to view the surface as a realization from a spatial process. We show how such modeling can be formalized in the context of Gaussian responses providing attractive interpretation in terms of both random effects and explaining residuals. We also offer extensions to generalized linear models and to spatio-temporal setting. We illustrate both static and dynamic modeling with a dataset that attempts to explain (log) selling price of single-family houses. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2003 American Statistical Association},

abstract = {We present a method to estimate paleomagnitude and rupture extent from measurements of displacement at a single point on a fault. The variability of historic ruptures is summarized in a histogram of normalized slip, then scaled to give the probability of finding a given displacement within a rupture for any magnitude considered. The histogram can be inverted assuming any magnitude earthquake is as likely as another, yielding probability density functions of magnitude and rupture length for any given displacement measurement. To improve these distributions we include a term to account for the probability that the earthquake would cause ground rupture and two alternative distributions of earthquake magnitude. The Gutenberg- Richter magnitude distribution predicts shorter rupture lengths and smaller magnitudes than does a uniform distribution where any magnitude earthquake is considered equally likely. Longer ruptures and larger magnitudes than the uniform model are predicted by an alternative magnitude distribution designed to return site average displacement. This model is a generalization of the characteristic earthquake model, and reasonably describes paleoseismic findings on the southern San Andreas fault, where slip is accommodated by average displacements of a few meters and earthquake recurrence times of 100-250 years. Our results should increase the value of paleoseismic displacement measurements for hazard assessment. In particular, they quantify probability estimates of earthquake magnitude and rupture length where point observations of rupture displacement are available, and so can contribute to probabilistic seismic-hazard analyses.

abstract = {This manuscript addresses the needs for forest scientists to overcome computational hurdles associated with analyzing massive spatial datasets and answering complex inferential questions regarding underlying processes. The primary focus is on reparametrizations and alternate formulations of the recently proposed hierarchical Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP) models (Datta et al., 2016) for improved convergence, better run times, and more robust and reproducible Bayesian inference. Our specific application employs "Light Detection and Ranging" (LiDAR) data to deliver complete coverage forest canopy height prediction maps with associated uncertainty estimates. A major hurdle the very large number of spatial locations (in the order of a few millions). We offer detailed algorithms to ensure efficient CPU memory management and exploit high-performance numerical linear algebra for executing the analysis. Our substantive data analytic contributions pertain to fully process-based posterior inference to accommodate incomplete coverage information from LiDAR instruments, which are essential in advancing our understanding of forest structure and effectively monitoring forest resource dynamics over time. We assess the computational and inferential benefits of these alternate NNGP specifications using simulated data sets and LiDAR data collected over the US Forest Service Tanana Inventory Unit (TIU) in a remote portion of Interior Alaska. The resulting data product is the first statistically robust map of forest canopy for the TIU.},

abstract = {The Gaussian process is an indispensable tool for spatial data analysts. The onset of the "big data" era, however, has lead to the traditional Gaussian process being computationally infeasible for modern spatial data. As such, various alternatives to the full Gaussian process that are more amenable to handling big spatial data have been proposed. These modern methods often exploit low rank structures and/or multi-core and multi-threaded computing environments to facilitate computation. This study provides, first, an introductory overview of several methods for analyzing large spatial data. Second, this study describes the results of a predictive competition among the described methods as implemented by different groups with strong expertise in the methodology. Specifically, each research group was provided with two training datasets (one simulated and one observed) along with a set of prediction locations. Each group then wrote their own implementation of their method to produce predictions at the given location and each which was subsequently run on a common computing environment. The methods were then compared in terms of various predictive diagnostics. Supplementary materials regarding implementation details of the methods and code are available for this article online.},

abstract = {The Mississippi embayment, located in the central United States, and its thick deposits of sediments (over 1 km in places) have a large effect on earthquake ground motions. Several previous studies have addressed how these thick sediments might modify probabilistic seismic-hazard maps. The high seismic hazard associated  with the New Madrid seismic zone makes it particularly important to quantify the uncertainty in modeling site amplification to better represent earthquake hazard in seismic-hazard maps. The methodology of the Memphis urban seismic-hazard- mapping project (Cramer et al., 2004) is combined with the reference profile approach of Toro and Silva (2001) to better estimate seismic hazard in the Mississippi embayment. Improvements over previous approaches include using the 2002 national seismic-hazard model, fully probabilistic hazard calculations, calibration of site amplification with improved nonlinear soil-response estimates, and estimates of uncertainty. Comparisons are made with the results of several previous studies, and estimates of uncertainty inherent in site-amplification modeling for the upper Mississippi embayment are developed. I present new seismic-hazard maps for the upper Mississippi embayment with the effects of site geology incorporating these uncertainties.},

abstract = {Discretization is a crucial preprocessing technique used for a variety of data warehousing and mining tasks. In this paper, we present a novel PCA-based unsupervised algorithm for the discretization of continuous attributes in multivariate data sets. The algorithm leverages the underlying correlation structure in the data set to obtain the discrete intervals and ensures that the inherent correlations are preserved. Previous efforts on this problem are largely supervised and consider only piecewise correlation among attributes. We consider the correlation among continuous attributes and, at the same time, also take into account the interactions between continuous and categorical attributes. Our approach also extends easily to data sets containing missing values. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on real data sets and as a preprocessing step for both classification and frequent itemset mining tasks. We show that the intervals are meaningful and can uncover hidden patterns in data. We also show that large compression factors can be obtained on the discretized data sets. The approach is task independent, i.e., the same discretized data set can be used for different data mining tasks. Thus, the data sets can be discretized, compressed, and stored once and can be used again and again.},

@article{Zhang2018,
abstract = {With continued advances in Geographic Information Systems and related computational technologies, statisticians are often required to analyze very large spatial datasets. This has generated substantial interest over the last decade, already too vast to be summarized here, in scalable methodologies for analyzing large spatial datasets. Scalable spatial process models have been found especially attractive due to their richness and flexibility and, particularly so in the Bayesian paradigm, due to their presence in hierarchical model settings. However, the vast majority of research articles present in this domain have been geared toward innovative theory or more complex model development. Very limited attention has been accorded to approaches for easily implementable scalable hierarchical models for the practicing scientist or spatial analyst. This article is submitted to the Practice section of the journal with the aim of developing massively scalable Bayesian approaches that can rapidly deliver Bayesian inference on spatial process that are practically indistinguishable from inference obtained using more expensive alternatives. A key emphasis is on implementation within very standard (modest) computing environments (e.g., a standard desktop or laptop) using easily available statistical software packages without requiring message-parsing interfaces or parallel programming paradigms. Key insights are offered regarding assumptions and approximations concerning practical efficiency.},

@article{Wagener2016,
abstract = {Ground motion intensity measures such as the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and the pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) at two sites due to the same seismic event are correlated. The spatial correlation needs to be considered when modeling ground-motion fields for seismic loss assessments, since it can have a significant influence on the statistical moments and probability distribution of aggregated seismic loss of a building portfolio.Empirical models of spatial correlation of ground motion intensity measures exist only for a few seismic regions in the world such as Japan, Taiwan and California, since for this purpose a dense observation network of earthquake ground motion is required. The Istanbul Earthquake Rapid Response and Early Warning System (IERREWS) provides one such dense array with station spacing of typically 2 km in the urban area of Istanbul. Based on the records of eight small to moderate (Mw3.5-Mw5.1) events, which occurred since 2003 in the Marmara region, we establish a model of intra-event spatial correlation for PGA and PSA up to the natural period of 1.0 s.The results indicate that the correlation coefficients of PGA and short-period PSA decay rapidly with increasing interstation distance, resulting in correlation lengths of approximately 3-4 km, while correlation lengths at longer natural periods (above 0.5 s) exceed 6 km. Finally, we implement the correlation model in a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate economic loss in Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu due to a Mw7.2 scenario earthquake.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2012, i6doc.com publication. All rights reserved. In this paper we present a hierarchical model of linear regression functions in the context of multi–task learning. The parameters of the linear model are coupled by a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior, which implies a clustering of related functions for different tasks. To make approximate Bayesian inference under this model we apply the Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (BHC) algorithm. The experiments are conducted on two real world problems: (i) school exam score prediction and (ii) prediction of ground–motion parameters. In comparison to baseline methods with no shared prior the results show an improved prediction performance when using the hierarchical model.},

abstract = {Correlations of the recorded peak acceleration, velocity and displacement, and the modified Mercalli intensity have been carried out for 57 earthquakes and 187 strong-motion accelerograms recorded in the Western United States. Correlations of peak acceleration with intensity, characterized by the data scatter exceeding one order of magnitude, have led to average peak accelerations which are higher than those reported by a majority of previous investigators. New correlations, also characterized by scatter of data of about one order of magnitude, have been presented for peak velocities and displacements of strong ground motion versus modified Mercalli intensity. Grouping of all recorded data according to the geology underlying the strong-motion accelerograph stations was carried out and permitted a study of the possible effects that local geology might have on the peaks of strong-motion acceleration, velocity, and displacement. Results of this analysis are as follows: (1) For ground shaking of a particular modified Mercalli intensity, average peak acceleration recorded on hard rock is higher by a factor less than about two than the average peak acceleration recorded on alluvium; (2) the effect of local geology on the average peak velocity leads to marginally higher peak values-on alluvium; and (3) the peak ground displacements are larger, by a factor less than two, when recorded on alluvium rather than on hard rock.},

Using a hybrid parallelization approach that uses both threading (shared memory) and message-passing (distributed memory), we implement the core linear algebra operations used in spatial statistics and Gaussian process regression in an R package called bigGP that relies on C and MPI. The approach divides the matrix into blocks such that the computational load is balanced across processes while communication between processes is limited. The package provides an API enabling R programmers to implement Gaussian process-based methods by using the distributed linear algebra operations without any C or MPI coding. We illustrate the approach and software by analyzing an astrophysics dataset with n=67,275 observations.},

@article{DiGiacomo2015,
abstract = {This paper outlines the re-computation and compilation of the magnitudes now contained in the final ISC-GEM Reference Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1900-2009). The catalogue is available via the ISC website (www.isc.ac.uk/iscgem/) and lists in a comma separated format the location and magnitude parameters (with corresponding uncertainties) of global large earthquakes. In this work we report on the procedures adopted to obtain the final magnitude composition of the nearly 20,000 earthquakes processed. We have made every effort to use uniform procedures of magnitude determination throughout the entire period of the catalogue. The re-computation of the surface wave MSand short-period body-wave mbvalues benefitted from new hypocentres (Bond{\'{a}}r et al., 2015), previously unavailable amplitude-period data digitized during this project (Di Giacomo et al., 2015), and a more reliable algorithm for magnitude estimation based on a 20{\%} alpha-trimmed median magnitude (Bond{\'{a}}r and Storchak, 2011). In particular, for MSuntil the end of 1970 we have processed an unprecedented amount of data and obtained several thousands of station magnitudes not available before. The available re-computed MSand mbprovided an ideal basis for deriving new conversion relationships to moment magnitude MW. Therefore, rather than using previously published regression models, we derived new empirical relationships using both generalized orthogonal linear and exponential non-linear models to obtain MWproxies from MSand mb. The new models were tested against true values of MW, and the newly derived exponential models were then preferred to the linear ones in computing MWproxies.For the final magnitude composition of the ISC-GEM catalogue, we preferred directly measured MWvalues as published by the Global CMT project for the period 1976-2009 (plus intermediate-depth earthquakes between 1962 and 1975). In addition, over 1000 publications have been examined to obtain direct seismic moment M0and, therefore, also MWestimates for 967 large earthquakes during 1900-1978 (Lee and Engdahl, 2015) by various alternative methods to the current GCMT procedure. In all other instances we computed MWproxy values by converting our re-computed MSand mbvalues into MW, using the newly derived non-linear regression models. The final magnitude composition is an improvement in terms of magnitude homogeneity compared to previous catalogues. The magnitude completeness is not homogeneous over the 110. years covered by the ISC-GEM catalogue. Therefore, seismicity rate estimates may be strongly affected without a careful time window selection. In particular, the ISC-GEM catalogue appears to be complete down to MW5.6 starting from 1964, whereas for the early instrumental period the completeness varies from {\~{}}7.5 to 6.2. Further time and resources would be necessary to homogenize the magnitude of completeness over the entire catalogue length.},

abstract = {An estimate of the Fourier amplitude spectrum of horizontal shear-wave motion is obtained using the Brune seismic source model in the presence of anelastic attenuation, from which the root-mean-square acceleration (arms) can be calculated. Predicted spectral amplitudes and values of arms are compared to observations for 160 free-field or basement-level components of horizontal acceleration of the San Fernando earthquake. For a stress drop of 50 bars and a faulting duration of 10 sec, observed and predicted spectral amplitudes and values of arms are in reasonable agreement: the observations conform to the predicted attenuation with distance (which is frequency-dependent for spectral amplitudes and proportional to R-3/2 for arms), but exceed predicted values by an average factor of about 3. Some of this difference is attributable to azimuthal variation in source excitation and the highly nonuniform distribution of stations with azimuth; the remainder results from the high-stress drop associated with the initial rupture for this earthquake. Predictions made by the model are nonetheless in agreement, both in terms of attenuation and amplitude, with spectral amplitudes estimated by empirical models calibrated with records from a wide variety of earthquakes.},

abstract = {Summary The lateral variation of Lg wave spectral attenuation in Central America was studied through tomographic inversion at various frequencies between 0.5 and 5 Hz, separately for each frequency. The input data set consisted of 558 travel paths recorded on short-period and broad-band seismic stations in the region. The size and quality of the data set were sufficient to resolve significant lateral variation in the Lg wave quality factor QLg . The average dependence of QLg with frequency was found to be QLg(f) = 182f0.84 , corresponding to high attenuation. Low QLg values in the Nicaraguan Depression presented the most significant variation from the average. The strong attenuation of Lg waves in the Nicaraguan depression was also observed in the visual analysis of the seismograms. This observation is possibly explained by the near-surface low-velocity layers in the depression. Low QLg values were also found along the chain of volcanos due to increased scattering and partial melting beneath the volcanic belt. This study is the first attempt to determine QLg for Central America and to provide knowledge on attenuation of Lg waves needed for the prediction of ground motion during future earthquakes.},

@article{Haendel2014a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. In probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, different ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are commonly combined within a logic tree framework. The selection of appropriate GMPEs, however, is a non-trivial task, especially for regions where strong motion data are sparse and where no indigenous GMPE exists because the set of models needs to capture the whole range of ground-motion uncertainty. In this study we investigate the aggregation of GMPEs into a mixture model with the aim to infer a backbone model that is able to represent the center of the ground-motion distribution in a logic tree analysis. This central model can be scaled up and down to obtain the full range of ground-motion uncertainty. The combination of models into a mixture is inferred from observed ground-motion data. We tested the new approach for Northern Chile, a region for which no indigenous GMPE exists. Mixture models were calculated for interface and intraslab type events individually. For each source type we aggregated eight subduction zone GMPEs using mainly new strong-motion data that were recorded within the Plate Boundary Observatory Chile project and that were processed within this study. We can show that the mixture performs better than any of its component GMPEs, and that it performs comparable to a regression model that was derived for the same dataset. The mixture model seems to represent the median ground motions in that region fairly well. It is thus able to serve as a backbone model for the logic tree.},

abstract = {Recently Zeng et al, (1994) proposed a composite source model for convolution with synthetic Green's functions for computing strong ground motion due to a complex rupture process of a large earthquake. The composite source consists of sub-events with a distribution of sizes, distributed randomly on the fault. In this paper, we extend our discussion of the source by allowing subevent rake to vary within the positive strain quadrant and by including the effect of the random lateral heterogeneity of the earth by adding scattered waves into the Green's function computed from a layered elastic earth model. Both of these variations contribute towards equalizing different components of the high frequency waveform train. The random scattering has the stronger effect on increasing the amplitudes of the nodal components. The early part of these scattered coda waves also tends to elongate the strong shaking of the earthquake.},

@article{Kowsari2019,
abstract = {In this study, we propose a data-driven method using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) to select the most suitable earthquake ground motion model (GMM) for application in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). The standard deviation (sigma) of the GMM is an important parameter for PSHA and plays an important role in data-driven methods. The main advantage of the proposed procedure is to introduce the posterior sigma as the key quantity for objectively ranking different candidate models against a given earthquake ground motion dataset. In the context of the Bayesian statistical framework, sigma is then determined for a given GMM based on the observed ground motions and at the same time takes into account the misfit of the GMM predictions to the observed ground motions. This feature addresses issues associated with other ranking methods where in some cases a considerable bias between the GMM predictions and the observed ground motions is effectively ignored. On the contrary, the DIC considers the influence of these two factors together by ranking models more favorably when they are associated with smaller bias and the determined sigma is close to the actual variability of the ground motions in the region under study. We submit the DIC method of this study as a useful and objective method for evaluating the performance of a GMM to a given dataset. This has potentially important application for PSHA when using multiple GMMs and either logic tree or backbone approaches are required to handle epistemic uncertainty in an appropriate manner.},

abstract = {We estimate the variance in ground motions related to repeated large earthquakes occurring on the same fault segment with similar magnitudes. We find eight earthquake pairs for which suitable strong-motion records exist. Two are crustal strike-slip earthquakes from California and six are subduction zone earthquakes from Japan.We consider only large earthquakes and deal with frequencies greater than the earthquake corner frequency, so the variability that is considered here is related to smaller scale differences in the rupture process, particularly on the part of the fault nearest the station.We find that the variance of the 5{\%} damped spectral accelerations of these pairs, termed $\tau$2 F, averages to about 45{\%} and 80{\%} of $\tau$2 for the crustal and subduction zone earthquakes, respectively, in which $\tau$2 is the contribution of source variability to the total variability of ground motion estimated by some recent ground- motion prediction equations.We suggest that $\tau$2 F is lower than $\tau$2, for the frequencies at which $\tau$2 F is estimated, because it depends primarily on only local physical properties of a fault that are the same in repeated earthquakes.We therefore suggest that at sites where the hazard is controlled by a single rerupturing source, one could potentially use a between-event variance that is smaller than $\tau$2 in seismic-hazard calculations. Thus, these results may help to resolve the inconsistencies that are now present between the national hazard maps and some precariously balanced rocks in southern California. Introduction},

abstract = {Recent studies to assess very long-term seismic hazard in the United States and in Europe have brought the issue of upper limits on earthquake ground motions into the arena of problems requiring attention from the engineering seismological community. Few engineering projects are considered sufficiently critical to warrant the use of annual frequencies of exceedance so low that ground-motion estimates may become unphysical if limiting factors are not considered, but for nuclear waste repositories, for example, the issue is of great importance. The definition of upper bounds on earthquake ground- motions also presents an exciting challenge for researchers in the area of seismic hazard assessment. This paper looks briefly at historical work on maximum values of ground- motion amplitudes, before illustrating why this is an important issue for hazard assessments at very long return periods. The paper then discusses the factors that control the extreme values of motion, both in terms of generating higher amplitude bedrock motions and in terms of limiting the values of motion at the ground surface. Possible channels of research that could be explored in the quest to define the maximum possible ground motions are also discussed.},

@article{Chandler2001,
abstract = {The design response spectrum is typically the starting point of most codified seismic design and assessment procedures and is predominantly used to prescribe the applied inertia forces induced by earthquake ground motions. In a recent paper, the authors presented and discussed the key properties, limitations, engineering interpretation and modern concepts relating to various types of earthquake design response spectra, including the acceleration, displacement and velocity spectra. The present paper provides a critical evaluation of the various deterministic and probabilistic approaches to response spectrum modelling, including an introduction to the Component Attenuation Model (CAM). The CAM modelling approach was developed recently by the authors, with the express purpose of providing a novel response spectrum modelling technique for regions lacking earthquake records. Traditional approaches for the prediction of earthquake actions using design response spectra rely on accurate hazard models for the region concerned, which in turn depend heavily on the availability of strong ground motion data from the local seismic region, or from analogous regions with similar geological and seismo-tectonic features. In the case of regions with low to moderate levels of seismicity, such data is at best scarce and in many cases unreliable, and this presents unique problems for designers carrying out seismic analysis for new construction or assessing the seismic reliability of existing buildings, bridges and infrastructure. For such regions, novel approaches (such as CAM) which adapt local seismological information for the purpose of earthquake ground motion modelling may be considered. Further key issues including the determination of the Maximum Considered Earthquake, are also addressed in this paper. KEYWORDS},

abstract = {Living in Christchurch and working in a community psychiatric team after the 7.1 MM intensity earthquake on 4 September 2010 provided the opportunity to examine the psychiatric literature on earthquakes and make some naturalistic observations about anxiety and earthquakes, with a particular focus on the impact of aftershocks. Literature search of articles were varied in nature but mostly commented on service delivery and the mental health consequences of a natural disaster. The period after an earthquake, when aftershocks were occurring, was associated with a further increase in blood pressure in a group of elderly outpatients with hypertension. There is additional literature examining the effects of earthquakes on coronary artery disease with an acute increase in coronary syndromes occurring on the day of major earthquakes, as well as in the years subsequently. The literature on earthquakes and aftershocks suggests that these events cause significant short and long-term mental and physical problems. This is consistent with observations in the Christchurch setting where the initial quake appeared to have a triggering effect and the uncertainty about aftershocks exacerbated frayed nerves and may have longer-term impacts on well-being.

abstract = {The selection of variables in regression problems has occupied the minds of many statisticians. Several Bayesian variable selection methods have been developed, and we concentrate on the following methods: Kuo {\&} Mallick, Gibbs Variable Selection (GVS), Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), adaptive shrinkage with Je{\AE}reys' prior or a Laplacian prior, and reversible jump MCMC. We review these methods, in the context of their di{\AE}erent properties. We then implement the methods in BUGS, using both real and simulated data as examples, and investigate how the di{\AE}erent methods perform in practice. Our results suggest that SSVS, reversible jump MCMC and adaptive shrinkage methods can all work well, but the choice of which method is better will depend on the priors that are used, and also on how they are implemented.},

abstract = {Various noninformative prior distributions have been suggested for scale parameters in hierarchical models. We construct a new folded-noncentral-t family of conditionally conjugate priors for hierarchical standard deviation pa- rameters, and then consider noninformative and weakly informative priors in this family. We use an example to illustrate serious problems with the inverse-gamma family of “noninformative” prior distributions. We suggest instead to use a uni- form prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-t family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.2.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propa- gation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line, through R using the RStan package, or through Python using the PyStan package. All three interfaces support sampling or optimization-based inference and analysis, and RStan and PyStan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, and data I/O.},

abstract = {We have used the Artificial Neural Network method (ANN) for the derivation of physically sound, easy-to-handle, predictive ground-motionmodels from a subset of the Reference database for Seismic ground-motion prediction in Europe (RESORCE). Only shallow earthquakes (depth smaller than 25 km) and recordings corresponding to stations with measured Vs30 properties have been selected. Five input parameters were selected: the moment magnitude MW, the Joyner–Boore distance RJ B, the focal mechanism, the hypocentral depth, and the site proxy VS30. A feed-forward ANN type is used, with one 5-neuron hidden layer, and an output layer grouping all the considered ground motion parameters, i.e., peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV) and 5{\%}-damped pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) at 62 periods from 0.01 to 4 s. A procedure similar to the random-effects approach was developed to provide between and within event standard deviations. The total standard deviation ($\sigma$) varies between 0.298 and 0.378 (log10 unit) depending on the period, with between-event and within-event variabilities in the range 0.149–0.190 and 0.258–0.327, respectively. Those values prove comparable to those of conventional GMPEs. Despite the absence of any a priori assumption on the functional dependence, our results exhibit a number of physically sound features: magnitude scaling of the distance dependency, near-fault sat-uration distance increasing with magnitude, amplification on soft soils and even indications for nonlinear effects in softer soils.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the BACCO bundle of R routines for carrying out Bayesian analysis of computer code output. The bundle comprises packages emulator and calibrator, computerized implementations of the ideas of Oakley and OHagan (2002) and Kennedy and OHagan (2001a) respectively. The bundle is self-contained and fully documented R code, and includes a toy dataset that furnishes a working example of the functions. Package emulator carries out Bayesian emulation of computer code output; package calibrator allows the incorporation of observational data into model calibration using Bayesian techniques. The package is then applied to a dataset taken from climate science.},

abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).},

The implications of various restrictions, especially symmetry restrictions, on scoring rules is explored, usually with a minimum of regularity hypothesis.},

@article{Kohrangi2016,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The earliest history of the Moon is poorly preserved in the surface geologic record because of the high flux of impactors, but aspects of that history may be preserved in subsurface structures. Application of gravity gradiometry to observations by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission results in the identification of a population of linear gravity anomalies with lengths of hundreds of kilometers. Inversion of the gravity anomalies indicates elongated positive density anomalies interpreted to be ancient vertical tabular intrusions or dikes, formed by magmatism in combination with extension of the lithosphere. Crosscutting relationships support a pre-Nectarian to Nectarian age, preceding the end of the heavy bombardment of the Moon. The distribution, orientation, and dimensions of the intrusions indicate a globally isotropic extensional stress state arising from an increase in the Moon's radius by 0.6 to 4.9 km early in lunar history, consistent with predictions of thermal models.},

abstract = {A cumulative frequency-magnitude relation, the Gutenberg–Richter law, dominates the statistics of the occurrence of earthquakes. Although it is an empirical law, some authors have tried to give some physical meaning to its a and b parameters. Here, we recall some theoretical expressions for the probability of occurrence of an earthquake with magnitude M in terms of a and b values. A direct consequence of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the maximum entropy principle (MEP) is that a and b values can be expressed as a function of the mean magnitude of a seismic sequence over a certain area. We then introduce the definition of the Shannon entropy of earthquakes and show how it is related to the b value. In this way, we also give a physical interpretation to the b value: the negative logarithm of b is the entropy of the magnitude frequency of earthquake occurrence. An application of these concepts to two case studies, in particular to the recent seismic sequence in Abruzzi (central Italy; mainshock Mw 6.3, 6 April 2009 in L'Aquila) and to an older 1997 sequence (Umbria-Marche, central Italy; mainshock Mw 6.0, 26 September 1997 in Colfiorito), confirms their potential to help in understanding the physics of earthquakes. In particular, from the comparison of the two cases, a simple scheme of different regimes in succession is proposed in order to describe the dynamics of both sequences.},

abstract = {Strong-motion data recorded within 50 km of the rupture zone were used to study near-source attenuation characteristics of horizontal peak ground acceleration for worldwide earthquakes of magnitudes 5.0 to 7.7. The data base consisted of 229 horizontal components of peak acceleration recorded from 27 earthquakes, including the 15 October 1979, Imperial Valley earthquake. These data were found to be adequately represented by the functional relationship [IMG] fd1.gif“ ALT=”Formula“ BORDER=”0“{\textgreater} where PGA represents the mean of the peak values scaled from the two horizontal components of each recording, M is Richter magnitude, and R is distance from the fault rupture zone. Peak acceleration was found to be lognormally distributed with a standard error representing a 45 per cent increase in the median estimate. The regression analysis statistically confirmed the results of earthquake simulation studies that have predicted peak acceleration to become independent of magnitude and distance in the near field. An extensive sensitivity study showed that predictions based on our attenuation relationships are stable with respect to reasonable model and parameter variations. An analysis of residuals was used to investigate the behavior of peak acceleration with respect to various earthquake, site, and recording parameters, the more significant findings being: (1) a similarity in the level of acceleration recorded on soil or rock; (2) larger than average accelerations recorded at sites located on shallow soils or in areas of steep topography; (3) larger than average accelerations associated with earthquakes having reverse fault mechanisms; and (4) lower than average accelerations recorded in large embedded structures.},

abstract = {AbstractThis paper details an integrated method for the multi-hazard risk assessment of road infrastructure systems exposed to potential earthquake and flood events. A harmonisation effort is required to reconcile bridge fragility models and damage scales from different hazard types: this is achieved by the derivation of probabilistic functionality curves, which express the probability of reaching or exceeding a loss level given the seismic intensity measure. Such probabilistic tools are essential for the loss assessment of infrastructure systems, since they directly provide the functionality losses instead of the physical damage states. Multi-hazard interactions at the vulnerability level are ensured by the functionality loss curves, which result from the assembly of hazard-specific fragility curves for local damage mechanisms. At the hazard level, the potential overlap between earthquake and flood events is represented by a time window during which the effects of one hazard type on the infrastructure may still be present: the value of this temporal parameter is based on the repair duration estimates provided by the functionality loss curves. The proposed framework is implemented through Bayesian Networks, thus enabling the propagation of uncertainties and the computation of joint probabilities. The procedure is demonstrated on a bridge example and a hypothetical road network.},

abstract = {We present the results of the regression analyses between Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) intensity and the spectral acceleration (SA) at 0.3, 1.0 and 2.0 s (SA03, SA10 and SA20). In Italy, the MCS scale is used to describe the level of ground shaking suffered by manufactures or perceived by the people, and it differs to some extent from the Mercalli Modified scale in use in other countries. We have assembled a new SA/MCS-intensity data set from the DBMI04 intensity database and the ITACA accelerometric data bank. The SA peak values are calculated in twoways—using the maximum among the two horizontal components, and using the geometrical mean among the two horizontal components. The regression analysis has been performed separately for the two kinds of data sets and for the three target periods. Since both peak ground parameters and intensities suffer of appreciable uncertainties, we have used the orthogonal distance regression technique. Also, tests designed to assess the robustness of the estimated coefficients have shown that single-line parametrizations for the regressions are sufficient to model the data within the model uncertainties. For the maximum horizontal component, SAxxhm, the new relations are IMCS = (1.24±0.33)+(2.47±0.18) log SA0.3shm,$\sigma$ = 0.53, IMCS = (3.12±0.16)+(2.05±0.11) log SA1.0shm,$\sigma$ = 0.36, IMCS = (4.31±0.10)+(2.00±0.10) log SA2.0shm,$\sigma$ = 0.29. For the geometrical mean SA, SAxxgm, the new relations are IMCS = (1.40±0.31)+(2.46±0.18) log SA0.3sgm,$\sigma$ = 0.53, IMCS = (3.25±0.16)+(2.08±0.12) log SA1.0sgm,$\sigma$ = 0.38, IMCS = (4.46±0.10)+(2.01±0.10) log SA2.0sgm,$\sigma$ = 0.30. Adoption of the geometric mean of the horizontal components, rather than their maximum value, results in a minor shift towards larger values of intensity for the same level of ground motion; this difference, however, is contained within the regression standard errors of the former. Comparisons carried out in various manners for earthquakes where both kinds of data (macroseismic and instrumental data) are available have shown the general effectiveness of the relations.},

abstract = {A small aperture seismic array has been deployed along a 30-km stretch of the San Jacinto fault in the vicinity of the town of Anza, California. The array was installed to study specifically the scaling laws of body-wave spectra, the char-acter of high-frequency ground motion, the physical interpretation of seismic stress drops, and the interaction of earthquakes. This region was chosen for these studies due to its high rate of seismic activity in the 2 {\_}-{\textless} M ={\textless} 4.5 range, the likelihood of a M {\textgreater} 6 event in the next decade, and the existence of the Southern California Batholith on either side of the fault, reducing problems associated with attenuation and large scale anisotropy. These studies employ an instrument package with a frequency response of 100 Hz, a dynamic range of 138 dB, a sampling rate of 250 times per second per component, and a 16-bit A/D converter. The array consists of 10 three-component stations, telemetered via digital VHF radio to a nearby mountain peak and thence via a microwave link to La Jolla, California. A minicomputer system monitors the array's performance, detects events, and records data upon demand. Initial results demonstrate the feasibility of digital transmission with an inherent increase in data quality over analog systems.},

abstract = {Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are typically estimated via regression of a ground-motion parameter of interest (such as peak ground accel-eration or spectral acceleration) against source-, path-, and site-related parameters, such as magnitude, distance, or time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (V S30), with physical considerations taken into account. Typically, the predictor variables are treated as error free in the regression; however, there can be significant errors in these parameters because magnitudes are often converted from one scale to another (such as local magnitude to moment magnitude) and V S30 is often inferred from local geology instead of measured. We propose a Bayesian measurement error model that allows one to take into account measurement uncertainty in predictor var-iables, such as magnitude, in the development of a GMPE. The model treats the value of the predictor variable as a parameter to be estimated, constrained by its observed value and (known) variance of the measurement error. The model is cast in a Bayesian fashion to allow the inclusion of relevant prior information, as well as a probabilistic interpretation of the results. We apply the model to California data of the Next Generation Attenuation-West2 data set and take into account measurement error in magnitudes and V S30 . We find that the median predictions are similar when compared with a standard regression but that the values of the between-event standard deviation $\tau$ and the within-event/within-station standard deviation ϕ S2S are reduced by about 1{\%}–13{\%}, depending on the spectral period.},

abstract = {Spatial process models for analyzing geostatistical data entail computations that become prohibitive as the number of spatial locations become large. This manuscript develops a class of highly scalable Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP) models to provide fully model-based inference for large geostatistical datasets. We establish that the NNGP is a well-defined spatial process providing legitimate finite-dimensional Gaussian densities with sparse precision matrices. We embed the NNGP as a sparsity-inducing prior within a rich hierarchical modeling framework and outline how computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be executed without storing or decomposing large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations, thereby rendering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of the NNGP over competing methods using simulation studies and also analyze forest biomass from a massive United States Forest Inventory dataset at a scale that precludes alternative dimension-reducing methods.},

abstract = {Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is currently the soundest basis for the rational evaluation of ground-motion hazard for site-specific engineering design and assessment purposes. An increasing number of building codes worldwide acknowledge the uniform hazard spectra as the reference to determine design actions on structures and to select input ground motions for seismic structural analysis. This is the case, for example, in Italy where the new seismic code also requires the seismic input for nonlinear dynamic analysis to be selected on the basis of dominating events, for example, identified via disaggregation of seismic hazard. In the present study, the design earthquakes expressed in terms of representative magnitude (M), distance (R), and{\{}varepsilon{\}} were investigated for a wide region in the southern Apennines, Italy. To this aim, the hazards corresponding to peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration at 1 sec with a return period of 475 yr were disaggregated. For each of the disaggregation variables the shape of the joint and marginal probability density functions were studied. The first two modes expressed by M, R, and{\{}varepsilon{\}} were extracted and mapped for the study area. The results shown provide additional information, in terms of source and ground-motion parameters, to be used along with the standard hazard maps to better select the design earthquakes. The analyses also allow us to assess how various frequency ranges of the design spectrum are differently contributed by seismic sources in the study area.

abstract = {We consider the problem of forecasting future regional climate. Ourmethod is based on blending different members of an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) simu- lations while accounting for the discrepancies between these simulations, under present day conditions, and observational records for the recent past. To this end, we develop Bayesian space-timemodels that assess the discrepancies between climatemodel simu- lations and observational records. Those discrepancies are then propagated into the fu- ture to obtain blended forecasts of 21st century climate. The model allows for location- dependent spatial heterogeneities, providing local comparisons between the different simulations. Additionally, we estimate the different modes of spatial variability, and use the climate model-specific coefficients of the spatial factors for comparisons. We focus on regional climate model simulations performed in the context of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP).We consider, in particular, simulations from RegCM3 using three different forcings: NCEP, GFDL and CGCM3.We use simulations for two time periods: current climate conditions, cov- ering 1971 to 2000, and future climate conditions under the SRES A2 emissions sce- nario, covering 2041 to 2070. We investigate yearly mean summer temperature for a domain in the South West of the United States. The results indicated the RCM simu- lations underestimate the mean summer temperature increase for most of the domain compared to our model.},

abstract = {We used broadband waveforms collected at short hypocentral distances (r less than or equal to 40 km) during the Umbria-Marche (Italy) seismic sequence of September-November. 1997, in order to calculate the scaling relationships for the ground motion within the meizoseismal area, in the 0.5-16.0 Hz frequency band. Data were collected by a 10-station portable seismic network deployed by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica (Rome, Italy) shortly after the occurrence of the first mainshock of the sequence, on 26 September 1997. Among the thousands of events recorded, we selected 142 earthquakes characterized by good signal-to-noise ratios at all frequencies, and by the absence of multiple shocks within the time window spanned by each recording. The data set of the selected waveforms was made of 2030 horizontal-component seismograms. The logarithm of the peak values of narrow bandpass-filtered versions of the velocity time histories are modeled at each frequency as AMP(f, r) = EXC(f, r(ref)) + SITE(f) + D(r, r(ref), f). EXC(f,r(ref),=) is the excitation term at an arbitrary reference hypocentral distance, r(ref); SITE(f) is a site term. The empirical attenuation functional, D(r,r(ref),f), represents an estimate of the average crustal response for the region, at the hypocentral distance r, at the frequency f. It is modeled by using the following functional form: D(r, r(ref), f) = log g(r) - log g(r(ref)) - pi f(r-r(ref))/beta Q(0)(f/f(ref))(eta); (f(ref) = 1.0 Hz, r(ref) = 10 km). g(r) = r(-1) is the body-wave geometrical spreading function; beta = 3.5 km/sec is the shear-wave velocity in the crust. Due to the constraints applied to the system prior to the regressions, the excitation term represents the expected peak ground motion at the reference distance, as it would be observed at a site representative of the average site response of the network. The random vibration theory (RVT) is used to obtain a theoretical prediction of the attenuation functional. For reproducing D(r,r(ref), f) we use the crustal attenuation parameter Q(f) = 130(f/f(ref))(0.10) obtained by Malagnini et al. (2000) from the analysis of a regional data set representative of the entire Apennines, in the (0.24-5.0 Hz) band. Two parameters are used to predict shapes and levels of the seismic spectra, the stress drop Delta sigma, and a high-frequency attenuation parameter KO The values used to reproduce the observed velocity spectra are Delta sigma = 200 bars; kappa(0) = 0.04 sec. The indicated stress drop was estimated in this region by Castro et al. (2000), on recordings of the largest shock of the Umbria-Marche sequence.},

abstract = {Probabilistic numerical methods aim to model numerical error as a source of epistemic uncertainty that is subject to probabilistic analysis and reasoning, enabling the principled propagation of numerical uncertainty through a computational pipeline. In this paper we focus on numerical methods for integration. We present probabilistic (Bayesian) versions of both Markov chain and Quasi Monte Carlo methods for integration and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for convergence rates, in both posterior mean and posterior contraction. The performance of probabilistic integrators is guaranteed to be no worse than non-probabilistic integrators and is, in many cases, asymptotically superior. These probabilistic integrators therefore enjoy the "best of both worlds", leveraging the sampling efficiency of advanced Monte Carlo methods whilst being equipped with valid probabilistic models for uncertainty quantification. Several applications and illustrations are provided, including examples from computer vision and system modelling using non-linear differential equations. A survey of open challenges in probabilistic integration is provided.},

abstract = {Regional seismic risk assessments and quantification of portfolio losses oftenrequire simulation of spatially distributed ground motions at multiple intensitymeasures. For a given earthquake, distributed ground motions are character-ized by spatial correlation and correlation between different intensity measures,known as cross-correlation. This study proposes a new spatial cross-correlationmodel for within-event spectral acceleration residuals that uses a combinationof principal component analysis (PCA) and geostatistics. Records from 45 earth-quakes are used to investigate earthquake-to-earthquake trends in applicationof PCA to spectral acceleration residuals. Based on the findings, PCA is used todetermine coefficients that linearly transform cross-correlated residuals to inde-pendent principal components. Nested semivariogram models are then fit toempirical semivariograms to quantify the spatial correlation of principal compo-nents. The resultant PCA spatial cross-correlation model is shown to be accurateand computationally efficient. A step-by-step procedure and an example arepresented to illustrate the use of the predictive model for rapid simulation ofspatially cross-correlated spectral accelerations at multiple periods.},

abstract = {We consider a problem of inference for the output of a computationally expensive computer model. We suppose that the model is to be used in a context where the values of one or more inputs are uncertain, so that the input configuration is a random variable. We require to make inference about the induced distribution of the output. This distri-bution is called the uncertainty distribution, and the general problem is known to users of computer models as uncertainty analysis. To be specific, we develop Bayesian inference for the distribution and density functions of the model output. Modelling the output, as a function of its inputs, as a Gaussian process, we derive expressions for the posterior mean and variance of the distribution and density functions, based on data comprising observed outputs at a sample of input configurations. We show that direct computation of these expressions may encounter numerical difficulties. We develop an alternative approach based on simulating approximate realisations from the posterior distribution of the output function. Two examples are given to illustrate our methods. 1. U  We consider a deterministic complex computer model which computes an output y from input x. Since x will typically be a vector we refer to it as the input configuration, and to individual elements of x as inputs. The output y will be a scalar, typically one element of an output vector. We formally represent y as a function of x, y=g(x). A common scenario is that the values of one or more inputs are uncertain, typically because it is impracticable to measure the input. We therefore consider X, the 'true' input configur-ation, to be a random variable with distribution G(x). Consequently the output Y =g(X) is a random variable, and it is the distribution of Y, known as the uncertainty distribution, that is of interest. If the model can be run at a large number of distinct input configurations with little computational effort, then the problem of uncertainty analysis has a straightforward solu-tion. We first draw a large sample of random input configurations from the input distri-bution G(x), and then evaluate the output of the computer model at each sampled input configuration to obtain a random sample of outputs. From this Monte Carlo sample one can then make the required inferences for the uncertainty distribution. In this paper we are interested in the case where the computer model is computationally expensive, to the extent that the Monte Carlo approach is not practicable. This is because the sample of},

abstract = {The 1985 prediction of a characteristic magnitude 6 Parkfield earthquake was unsuccessful, since no significant event occurred in the 95{\%} time window (1985-1993) anywhere near Parkfield. The magnitude 6 earthquake near Parkfield in 2004 failed to satisfy the prediction not just because it was late; it also differed in character from the 1985 prediction and was expectable according to a simple null hypothesis. Furthermore, the prediction was too vague in several important respects to meet the accepted definition of an earthquake prediction. An event occurring by chance and meeting the general description of the predicted one was reasonably probable. The original characteristic earthquake model has failed in comprehensive tests, yet it is still widely used. Modified versions employed in recent official seismic hazard calculations allow for interactions between segments and uncertainties in the parameters. With more adjustable parameters, the modified versions are harder to falsify. The characteristic model as applied at Parkfield and elsewhere rests largely on selected data that may be biased because they were taken out of context. We discuss implications of the 2004 event for earthquake prediction, the characteristic earthquake hypothesis, and earthquake occurrence in general.},

abstract = {Gaussian random fields (GRFs) are important building blocks in hierarchical models for spatial data, but their parameters typically cannot be consistently estimated under in-fill asymptotics. Even for stationary Mat$\backslash$'ern GRFs, the posteriors for range and marginal variance do not contract and for non-stationary models there is a high risk of overfitting the data. Despite this, there has been no practically useful, principled approach for selecting the prior on their parameters, and the prior typically must be chosen in an $\backslash$emph{\{}ad-hoc{\}} manner. We propose to construct priors such that simpler models are preferred, i.e. shrinking stationary GRFs towards infinite range and no effect, and shrinking non-stationary extensions towards stationary GRFs. We use the recent Penalised Complexity prior framework to construct a practically useful, tunable, weakly informative joint prior on the range and the marginal variance for a Mat$\backslash$'ern GRF with fixed smoothness. We then introduce extra flexibility in the covariance structure of the GRF through covariates and discuss how to extend the stationary prior. We apply the priors to a dataset of annual precipitation in southern Norway and show that the scheme for selecting the hyperparameters of the non-stationary extension leads to improved predictive performance over the stationary model.},

abstract = {In his opinion paper " Earthquake Hazard Maps and Objective Testing: The Hazard Mapper's Point of View, " Stirling (2012) makes the claim that probabilistic seismic hazard (PSH) maps " are tools developed to provide estimates of hazard for long return periods (e.g., hundreds to thousands of years) " (p. 231). He is referring to the applications of PSH models for nuclear facilities and hydro dam developments as successful examples of the probabilistic method. Stirling is recommending PSH applications such as the Yucca Mountain seismic project also for other areas. Despite Stirling's opinion, PSH maps in use today ob-viously should not be used for reasons noted here. Because such maps provide the basis for national seismic building codes in many countries, it is instructive to comment on such opinions from the perspective of a risk-analysis professional and a con-tributor to the current International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safety guide for seismic hazard analysis (IAEA, 2010). I will show that the PSH model currently in use does not pro-vide information on the explicit occurrence time dependency of earthquakes' ground motions, neither for short nor for long-er return periods, and that deviation of the observed seismic ground motions from PSH maps is a systematic characteristic of the applied methodology. PSH MODEL AND TIME DEPENDENCY Equation ((1)) shows the PSH model for a single seismic source for the calculation of the frequency of exceedance, $\lambda$ a $\lambda$ a  $\upsilon$ Z m u m 0 Z r∞ r0 f 1 mf 2 rjmP A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i drdm; (1) where v the mean rate of occurrence of earthquakes within the lower m 0 and the upper m u magnitude bounds,f 1 m is the magnitude recurrence relation, f 2 rjm is the distribution of distance between site and earthquake location (e.g., epicenter) for a given magnitude,P A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i  is the probability of exceedance that the predicted ground-motion-level A Pred exceeds the level a, and X i denotes other factors considered in the ground-motion model forming the basis for the calculation of the exceedance probability. Looking at the model, it is obvious that only the term vf 1 m can be related to a time dependency because of the assumed recurrence model of earthquakes. Typically a homo-geneous Poisson process of earthquake occurrence is assumed (Reiter, 1991). There are many unresolved issues regarding this assumption (Kl{\"{u}}gel, 2008) that will not be commented on here. All other characteristics in equation (1) are essentially spatial characteristics. They measure the chance that for a given point in space the ground-motion level a is exceeded. The probability P A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i  is by definition ≤ 1. There-fore, the PSH model does not reflect time dependency of seis-mic ground motions even for the simplest case of a single seismic source. The probability of exceedance P A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i  is cal-culated (ignoring upper bound ground-motion truncation and assuming a lognormal distribution of ground motions, the cur-rent standard model of probabilistic seismic hazard [PSHA]) as},

abstract = {Logic trees are currrently the most popular tool to quantify epistemic uncertainties in seismic hazard analysis. The assumption in this context, that the candidate models form a partition of a finite categorical model set, however, poses severe limitations in dealing with model redundancy. Here we demonstrate how these limitations can be overcome by representing models (here ground-motion models) as high-dimensional model feature vectors that can be thought of as spanning a two-dimensional model manifold in a high-dimensional space. The structure of this manifold can be analysed through a combination of SOM and Sammon's mapping. Using an information-theoretic distance metric for the generation of the SOMs results in information-based proximity maps that then represent epistemic uncertainty on the underlying models on a continuous interval scale. Here individual models can be seen as samples of a continuous model domain on which model redundancy is no longer an issue. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {Macroseismic intensity has recently attracted attention as a tool for validating probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) studies or as an alternative method for PSHA in countries where the historical catalog is much longer than the instrumental one. In Italy, the new seismic hazard map was recently produced using the Cornell-McGuire approach in terms of the peak ground acceleration characterized by a 10{\%} exceedance probability for an exposure time of 50 yr (Amax). We compare this map with an alternative one, produced using a different approach based on a nonparametric and zonation-free statistical analysis of local seismic histories. In this case, results are expressed in terms of the maximum intensity corresponding to an exceedance probability of not less than 10{\%} for an exposure time of 50 yr (Iref). In order to compare the two maps, we selected 1401 control sites, where local seismic history includes at least 10 intensity values relative to felt effects documented during past earthquakes. The values of Amax and Iref at these sites have been ranked in the respective domains. The spatial distribution of rank differences of Amax and Iref values shows a strong correlation with the seismogenic zoning used in the calculation of PSHA following the Cornell-McGuire approach. This suggests that the adopted zoning could be incomplete (some further "hidden" sources may exist) and too rough to capture actual seismogenic sources. Because more detailed zoning is prevented by the amount of data available, the results obtained suggest the preference of zonation-free approaches for seismic hazard assessment in Italy. Furthermore, among the possible zonation-free approaches, those that offer better exploitation of local information about the effects of past earthquakes would be preferred.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Many empirical relationships for the earthquake ground motion duration were developed for interplate region, whereas only a very limited number of empirical relationships exist for intraplate region. Also, the existing relationships were developed based mostly on the scaled recorded interplate earthquakes to represent intraplate earthquakes. To the author's knowledge, none of the existing relationships for the intraplate regions were developed using only the data from intraplate regions. Therefore, an attempt is made in this study to develop empirical predictive relationships of earthquake ground motion duration (i.e., significant and bracketed) with earthquake magnitude, hypocentral distance, and site conditions (i.e., roc k and soil sites) using the data compiled from intraplate regions of Canada, Australia, Peninsular India, and the central and southern parts of the USA. The compiled earthquake ground motion data consists of 600 records with moment magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 6.5 and hypocentral distances ranging from 4 to 1000 km. The non-linear mixed-effect (NLMEs) and logistic regression techniques (to account for zero duration) were used to fit predictive models to the duration data. The bracketed duration was found to be decreased with an increase in the hypocentral distance and increased with an increase in the magnitude of the earthquake. The significant duration was found to be increased with the increase in the magnitude and hypocentral distance of the earthquake. Both significant and bracketed durations were predicted higher in rock sites than in soil sites. The predictive relationships developed herein are compared with the existing relationships for interplate and intraplate regions. The developed relationship for bracketed duration predicts lower durations for rock and soil sites. However, the developed relationship for a significant duration predicts lower durations up to a certain distance and thereafter predicts higher durations compared to the existing relationships.},

In order to obtain a set of site coefficients and spectral shapes, we have first deduced an attenuation law for both horizontal and vertical motion. Site conditions are represented by the shear velocity averaged over the upper 30 m (V[sub s][sup 30]). Our site classification (4 categories similar to those proposed in the new EC8 and the UBC97) is based on borehole investigations at every station. This classification has permitted to distinguish clearly four response spectra which demonstrates the efficiency of V[sub s][sup 30] as characterising site conditions. Our law is then used to test site coefficients and spectral shapes of building codes EC8 and UBC97. Concerning spectral shapes and site coefficients, our results are found to be in good agreement with EC8 and UBC97 only if category B (400 {\textless} V[sub s][sup},

abstract = {We have analysed 202 seismograms recorded at 10 seismic stations in the northeast (NE) India region to infer the frequency-dependent attenuation characteristics of both P and S waves, in the frequency range from 1.5 to 24 Hz and in the distance range from 30 to 100 km. We used extended coda-normalization method to determine the attenuation of P wave (Q-1(P)) and S wave (Q-1(S)). The results show that both P and S waves undergo a strong attenuation along ray paths. The values of Q-1(P) and Q-1(S), corresponding to spectral amplitude decays, show strong frequency dependence and are expressed as Q-1(P) = (0.035 +/- 0.014)f-(0.96 +/- 0.01) and Q-1(S) = (0.014 +/- 0.006)f-(0.94 +/- 0.03), respectively, in 1.5-24 Hz. The ratio Q-1(P)/Q-1(S) is found to be larger than unity for the whole frequency range. The high frequency dependence of both P- and S waves indicate the highest attenuation among the world at lower frequencies.},

@article{Beauval2012,
abstract = {Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPE) are essential in probabilistic seismic hazard studies for estimating the ground motions generated by the seismic sources. In low-seismicity regions, only weak motions are available during the lifetime of accelerometric networks, and the equations selected for the probabilistic studies are usually models established from foreign data. Although most GMPEs have been developed for magnitudes 5 and above, the minimum magnitude often used in probabilistic studies in low-seismicity regions is smaller. Disaggregations have shown that, at return periods of engineering interest, magnitudes less than 5 may be contributing to the hazard. This paper presents the testing of several GMPEs selected in current international and national probabilistic projects against weak motions recorded in France (191 recordings with source-site distances up to 300 km, 3:8≤ M w ≤4:5). The method is based on the log-likelihood value proposed by Scherbaum et al. (2009). The best-fitting models (approximately 2:5 ≤ LLH ≤ 3:5) over the whole frequency range are the Cauzzi and Faccioli (2008), Akkar and Bommer (2010), and Abrahamson and Silva (2008) models. No significant regional variation of ground motions is highlighted, and the magnitude scaling could be the predominant factor in the control of ground-motion amplitudes. Furthermore, we take advantage of a rich Japanese dataset to run tests on randomly selected low-magnitude subsets, and confirm that a dataset of {\~{}}190 observations, the same size as the French dataset, is large enough to obtain stable LLH estimates. Additionally we perform the tests against larger magnitudes (5-7) from the Japanese dataset. The ranking of models is partially modified, indicating a magnitude scaling effect for some of the models, and showing that extrapolating testing results obtained from low-magnitude ranges to higher magnitude ranges is not straightforward.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques have revolutionized the field of Bayesian statistics. Their enormous power and their gener- alizability have rendered them the method of choice for statistical inference in many scientific disciplines. Their power is so great that they can even accommodate situations in which the structure of the statistical model itself is uncertain. However, the analysis of such “trans-dimensional” models is not easy, with several significant tech- nical and practical difficulties to overcome. In this paper we present a class of graphical models that allow relatively straightforward anal- ysis of a subset of these trans-dimensional problems.We also present a ‘guided tour' of the reversible jump methodology underlying our approach and discuss how each of the various difficulties has been circumvented. Our approach has been implemented using the Win- BUGS framework as a Gibbs-Metropolis sampling ‘engine'. The main advantage of this is that it affords the analyst much modelling flexi- bility: trans-dimensional sub-graphs may be used as generic compo- nents within an arbitrarily wide range of Bayesian graphical models. We present three example analyses to illustrate our approach.},

abstract = {The effects of near-surface soil stratigraphy on the amplitude and frequency content of ground motion are accounted for in most modern U.S. seismic design codes for building structures as a function of the soil conditions prevailing in the area of interest. Nonetheless, currently employed site-classification criteria do not adequately describe the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil formations, which prohibits the development of standardized procedures for the computationally efficient integration of nonlinear ground response analyses in broadband ground-motion simulations. In turn, the lack of a unified methodology for nonlinear site-response analyses affects both the prediction accuracy of site-specific ground-motion intensity measures and the evaluation of site-amplification factors when broadband simulations are used for the development of hybrid attenuation relations. In this article, we introduce a set of criteria for quantification of the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil profiles based on the site conditions and incident ground-motion characteristics, and we implement them to identify the least complex ground response prediction methodology required for the simulation of nonlinear site effects at three sites in the Los Angeles basin. The criteria are developed on the basis of a comprehensive nonlinear site-response modeling uncertainty analysis, which includes both detailed soil profile descriptions and statistical adequacy of ground-motion time histories. Approximate and incremental nonlinear models are implemented, and the limited site-response observations are initially compared to the ensemble site-response estimates. A suite of synthetic ground motions for rupture scenarios of weak, medium, and large magnitude events (M 3.5-7.5) is next generated, parametric studies are conducted for each fixed magnitude scenario by varying the source-to-site distance, and the variability introduced in ground-motion predictions is quantified for each nonlinear site-response methodology. A frequency index is developed to describe the frequency content of incident ground motion relative to the resonant frequencies of the soil profile, and this index is used in conjunction with the rock-outcrop acceleration peak amplitude (PGARO) to identify the site conditions and ground-motion characteristics where incremental nonlinear analyses should be employed in lieu of approximate methodologies. We show that the proposed intensity-frequency representation of ground motion may be implemented to describe the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil formations in broadband simulations by accounting both for the magnitude-distance-orientation characteristics of seismic motion and the profile stiffness characteristics. The synthetic ground-motion predictions are next used for the development of site-amplification factors for the alternative site-response methodologies, and the results are compared to published site factors of attenuation relations. For the site conditions investigated, currently established amplification factors compare well with synthetic simulations for class C and D site conditions, while long-period amplification factors are overestimated by a factor of 1.5 at the class E site, where site-specific nonlinear analyses should be employed for levels of PGARO{\textgreater}0.2g.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. Homogeneous estimates of moment magnitude (M) for small-to-moderate-magnitude (SMM) earthquakes are important to assess regional ground motion compared to global models. However, an estimate of M was available for only 6{\%} of the shallow crustal earthquakes in Iran from 1973 to 2013 in the database developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. Therefore, this study evaluates the existing conversion models, from M L , M s , and m b , to M, for M {\textgreater} 4.0 using the Iranian data set. Correlations between the residuals of these conversions were computed. A weighted estimate for M is presented that combines these conversion models using these correlations based on multivariate statistics. The conversion to M was improved with smaller standard deviations, especially when M L and m b were both available. The inverse-variance–weighted approach, which is common in practice, underestimates the standard deviations because it neglects the positive correlations between these variables.},

The weighting scheme automatically gives most weight to early lags and down- weights those lags with a small number of pairs. Although weights are derived assuming the data are Gaussian (normal), they are shown to be still appropriate in the setting where data are a (smooth) transform of the Gaussian case. The method of (iterated) generalized least squares, which takes into account correlation between variogram estimators at different lags, offer more statistical efficiency at the price of more complexity. Weighted least squares for the robust estimator, based on square root differences, is less of a compromise.},

abstract = {We have classified the attenuation of the Medveded, Sponheuer, and Karnik (MSK) intensity into five types (each as a function of the epicentral intensity Io) based on the mean radii of 254 isoseismal maps, mainly historical earthquakes in the Iberian Peninsula. Geographically representing each earthquake with its corresponding attenuation tendency, it can be seen that those with low attenuation lie west of the Peninsula and those with high attenuation in the south and east. This regionalization seems to be due as much to the seismotectonic characteristics (different crustal types and size of the earthquakes) as to the different construction types in each region. These attenuation values are similar to those of southern Europe, but much higher than those found in the United States. From the point of view of seismic-hazard evaluation, these laws represent an improvement with regard to those used so far. We have extended previous attenuation studies to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, and, in some points, differences of attenuation assignment of almost two degrees of intensity have been corrected.},

abstract = {A probabilistic seismic hazard assessment is developed here using maximum credible earthquake magnitude statistics and earthquake perceptibility hazard. Earthquake perceptibility hazard is defined as the probability a site perceives ground shaking equal to or greater than a selected ground motion level X, resulting from an earthquake of magnitude M, and develops estimates for the most perceptible earthquake magnitude, MP(max). Realistic and usable maximum magnitude statistics are obtained from both whole process and part process statistical recurrence models. These approaches are extended to develop relationships between perceptible earthquake magnitude hazard and maximum magnitude recurrence models that are governed by asymptotic and finite return period properties, respectively. Integrated perceptibility curves illustrating the probability of a specific level of perceptible ground motion due to all earthquakes over the magnitude range extending from -∞ to a magnitude Mi are then developed from reviewing site-specific magnitude perceptibility. These lead on to achieving site-specific annual probability of exceedance hazard curves for the example cities of Sofia and Thessaloniki for both horizontal ground acceleration and ground velocity. Both the maximum credible earthquake magnitude M3 and the most perceptible earthquake magnitude MP(max) are of importance to the earthquake engineer when approaching anti-seismic building design. Both forms of hazard are illustrated using contoured hazard maps for the region bounded by 39°-45°N, 19°-29°E. Patterns are observed for these magnitude hazard estimates-especially MP(max) specific to horizontal ground acceleration and horizontal ground velocity-and compared to inferred patterns of crustal deformation across the region. The full geographic region considered is estimated to be subject to a maximum credible earthquake magnitude M3-estimated using cumulative seismic moment release statistics-of 7.53 Mw, calculated from the full content of the adopted earthquake catalogue, while Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, is estimated a comparable value of 7.36 Mw. Sofia is also forecast most perceptible earthquake magnitudes for the lowest levels considered for horizontal ground acceleration of MPA(50) = 7.20 Mw and horizontal ground velocity of MPV(5) = 7.23 Mw for a specimen focal depth of 15 km. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Cross-validation can be used to measure a model's predictive accuracy for instance for the purpose of model comparison or selection. As exact cross-validation is often practically infeasible for Bayesian models because it requires too much time, approximate cross-validation methods have been developed; most notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). However, standard LOO-CV requires the likelihood to be factorizable, that is the observations have to be conditionally independent given the model parameters. Unfortunately, some important statistical models most notably in the context of temporal and spatial statistics are non-factorizable, but LOO-CV may still be an important measure for these models. For this reason, we derive how to compute and validate exact and approximate LOO-CV for non-factorizable models that follow a multivariate normal likelihood.},

abstract = {Peninsular India (10.0{\{}degrees{\}} N-28.0{\{}degrees{\}} N; 68.0{\{}degrees{\}} E-90.0{\{}degrees{\}} E) is one of the oldest and seismically most stable landmasses of the Indian plate. Recent seismic history, however, shows that more than five damaging earthquakes with magnitudes greater than Mw 6.0 have occurred in this region, highlighting the importance of seismic- hazard assessment for the region. This article estimates the probabilistic seismic hazard associated with peninsular India with a zoneless approach incorporating the observed seismic activity and known geological characteristics of the region. The seismicity parameters for hazard assessment have been estimated incorporating completeness criteria for various spans of the catalog data. The spatial and temporal variations of seismic activity have been modeled using different source models. Seismic source zones for the region have been defined on the basis of large-scale geological features, which are used for assigning the maximum possible earthquake potential. Due to the poorly known attenuation characteristics of the study region, three appropriate attenuation models have been used for the estimation of ground- motion parameters. Hazard maps for peninsular India have been developed using a convolution scheme based on weighting and incorporating various uncertainties involved while modeling different parameters. The comparison of the probabilistic seismic-hazard map developed herein with the hazard map specified in the Indian Standards shows that the design parameters in the Indian Standards may significantly underestimate the seismic hazard in some regions of peninsular India.

abstract = {A most basic issue in the study of music perception is the question of why humans are motivated to pay attention to, or create, musical messages, and why they respond emotionally to them, when such messages seem to convey no real-time relevant biological information as do speech, animal utterances, and environmental sounds. Expanding on previous work (Roederer, 1979,1982) three possibly concurrent factors will be examined: (1) The inborn motivation to train language-handling networks of the brain in the processing of simple, organized sound patterns as a prelude to the acquisition of language; (2) The need to extract the information contained in the "musical" components of speech; (3) The value of music as a means of transmitting information on emotional states and its effect in congregating and behaviorally equalizing masses of people. In the discussion, special attention will be paid to the role of motivation and emotion in auditory perception, to the fact that in humans limbic system functions can be activated by internally evoked images in complete detachment from the current state of environment and organism, and to the existence of two distinct strategies of cerebral information processing, namely short-term time sequencing, as required in speech communication and thinking, and holistic pattern recognition, as required in music perception.},

This method makes use of the Flinn--Engdahl regionalization scheme, seismotectonic information (plate boundaries, global geology, seismicity catalogs, and regional and local studies), and the source parameters available from the USGS National Earthquake Information Center in the minutes following an earthquake to give the best estimation of the setting and mechanism of the event. Depending on the tectonic setting, additional criteria based on hypocentral depth, style of faulting, and regional seismicity may be applied. For subduction zones, these criteria include the use of focal mechanism information and detailed interface models to discriminate among outer‐rise, upper‐plate, interface, and intraslab seismicity. The scheme is validated against a large database of recent historical earthquakes. Though developed to assess GMPE selection in Global ShakeMap operations, we anticipate a variety of uses for this strategy, from real‐time processing systems to any analysis involving tectonic classification of sources from seismic catalogs.Online Material: Tables and figures summarizing the proposed discrimination scheme and its performance.},

It is thus crucial that avalanche risk assessments are based on a consistent and proper assessment of the uncertainties involved in the modelling of the avalanche run-out zones and the estimations of the damage potential. We link a Bayesian network (BN) to a Geographic Information System (GIS) for avalanche risk assessment in order to facilitate the explicit modelling of all relevant parameters, their causal relations and the involved uncertainties in a spatially explicit manner. The suggested procedure is illustrated for a case study area (Davos, Switzerland) located in the Swiss Alps. We discuss the potential of such a model by comparing the risks estimated using the probabilistic framework to those obtained by a traditional risk assessment procedure. The presented model may serve as a basis for developing a consistent and unified risk assessment approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Seismological Society of America. All rights reserved. Probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis (PSHA) is the current tool of the trade used to estimate the future seismic demands at a site of interest. A modern PSHA represents a complex framework that combines different models with numerous inputs. It is important to understand and assess the impact of these inputs on the model output in a quantitative way. Sensitivity analysis is a valuable tool for quantifying changes of a model output as inputs are perturbed, identifying critical input parameters, and obtaining insight about the model behavior. Differential sensitivity analysis relies on calculating first-order partial derivatives of the model output with respect to its inputs; however, obtaining the derivatives of complex models can be challenging. In this study, we show how differential sensitivity analysis of a complex framework such as PSHA can be carried out using algorithmic/automatic differentiation (AD). AD has already been successfully applied for sensitivity analyses in various domains such as oceanography and aerodynamics. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of the AD methodology by comparing AD-derived sensitivities with analytically derived sensitivities for a basic case of PSHA using a simple ground-motion prediction equation. Second, we derive sensitivities via AD for a more complex PSHA study using a stochastic simulation approach for the prediction of ground motions. The presented approach is general enough to accommodate more advanced PSHA studies of greater complexity.},

abstract = {Recommendations for repairing and strengthening historic buildings after an earthquake and before the next in modern times go back to the contribution to the ICOMOS General Assembly of 1987 by Sir Bernard Fielden “Between two Earthquakes” (Fielden 1987). In that circumstance two important points were made: the first is that failure and damage should be used to understand performance and behaviour, so as to avoid measures that do not work. The second is that the engineer work should be integrated into the architecture historical methodology. Almost 30 years later this contribution investigate to which extent these two recommendations have been fulfilled, whether there is a common understanding between the conservation and the seismic engineering community and whether lessons from past failures are informing new strengthening strategies. 15.1},

@article{Neal2003,
abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal " slice " defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such " slice sampling " methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by " overrelaxation, " and for multivariate slice sampling by " reflection " from the edges of the slice.},

abstract = {A new earthquake catalogue for central, northern and northwestern Europe with unified M-w magnitudes, in part derived from chi-square maximum likelihood regressions, forms the basis for seismic hazard calculations for the Lower Rhine Embayment. Uncertainties in the various input parameters are introduced, a detailed seismic zonation is performed and a recently developed technique for maximum expected magnitude estimation is adopted and quantified. Applying the logic tree algorithm, resulting hazard values with error estimates are obtained as fractile curves (median, 16{\%} and 84{\%} fractiles and mean) plotted for pga (peak ground acceleration; median values for Cologne 0.7 and 1.2 m/s(2) for probabilities of exceedence of 10{\%} and 2{\%}, respectively, in 50 years), 0.4 s (0.8 and 1.5 m/s(2)) and 1.0 s (0.3 and 0.5 m/s(2)) pseudoacclerations, and intensity (I-0 = 6.5 and 7.2). For the ground motion parameters, rock foundation is assumed. For the area near Cologne and Aachen, maps show the median and 84{\%} fractile hazard for 2{\%} probability of exceedence in 50 years based on pga (maximum median value about 1.5 m/s(2)), and 0.4 s ({\textgreater} 2 m/s(2)) and 1.0 s (about 0.8 m/s(2)) pseudoaccelerations, all for rock. The pga 84{\%} fractile map also has a maximum value above 2 m/s(2) and shows similarities with the median map for 0.4 s. In all maps, the maximum values fall within the area 6.2-6.3 degrees E and 50.8-50.9 degrees N, i.e., east of Aachen.},

abstract = {We defined a seismogenic model for central Italy based on three layers of sources and computed the relative seismic-hazard maps. One layer is constituted by individual structures liable to generate major earthquakes (M [{\&}ge;]5.5). We defined them as seismogenic boxes by using geological information in terms of plan projection of active faults; the seismicity rates associated with an individual source are based on the geometry and kinematics of the fault; the recurrence model is controlled by the earthquake-source association, and, when possible, we defined the occurrence time of the last major event, using it in a time-dependent approach. Another layer is given by the instrumental seismicity analysis of the past two decades, which allows us to evaluate the background seismicity (M [{\~{}}]{\textless}5.5); using a sliding-window selection of events, we defined a model of regular adjacent cells of variable a and b values of the Gutenberg-Richter relation. The last layer utilizes all the instrumental earthquakes and the historical events not correlated to known structures (4.5 {\textless} M [{\~{}}]{\textless}6), by separating them into seismotectonic provinces shaped on a geological-structural basis. The seismic-hazard computations first use this layered model in a traditional probabilistic scheme. The results indicate a narrow belt of peak ground acceleration (PGA) higher than 0.30g (with standard deviation in attenuation functions) in the axial part of the Apennine chain, with a maximum spot of PGA {\textgreater}0.40g southeast of the area damaged by the 1997-1998 Umbria-Marche sequence (PGA expected not to be exceeded in 50 years at 90{\%} probability level). The background seismicity gives a nonnegligible contribution to the hazard, at least for first damage levels. Then, a simplified time-dependent hypothesis has been introduced for the individual sources alone, computing the conditional probability of occurrence of characteristic earthquakes for each source by Brownian passage time distributions. Adopting equivalent fictitious seismicity rates, we obtained maps referring to the next 50 years by using traditional codes. These results show that the contribution of the recently active sources vanishes, and the most hazardous sites are now located south of L'Aquila and in the Sulmona area. We consider that the methodology and results obtained are useful for seismic risk reduction strategies.},

abstract = {This tutorial addresses geometrical issues that concern the specification of high-dimensional sampling distributions in Bayesian inversion. We illustrate that simple, low-dimensional geometrical concepts that are sometimes used to construct such distributions may become completely distorted (and even untrue) in higher dimensional problems.This has important implications for Bayesian inversion: if a convenient sampling distribution is constructed using low dimensional geometrical concepts which cause it to differ from the distribution representing our prior information, these differences can become extremely expensive to correct in higher dimensions. Indeed, theymaymakea nonlinear inversion computationally intractable when this need not be the case. A crucial factor in Bayesian inversion is, therefore, whether onefirmly believes in a particular prior distribution. If so, this distribution may constitute the most efficient sampling distribution, even in cases where it is not straight- forward to draw samples from that prior distribution. The sampling artifacts described above then become irrelevant since they represent true prior beliefs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Seismological Society of America. All rights reserved. We present ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for vertical response spectra from Mexican interplate earthquakes at rock sites (National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program B class). Two options to obtain the vertical response spectrum are presented: (1) directly from the vertical-attenuation model and (2) by multiplying the horizontal spectral ordinates by the vertical-to-horizontal ratios. The equations were built as functions of magnitude and distance to the fault surface of the earthquake, using 40 interplate earthquakes. We compared our results with previous attenuation models for inslab and interplate earthquakes in Mexico, and other vertical-attenuation models in the world. The predicted intensities from the model were found to be in broad agreement with models derived with other models worldwide. Not many vertical and/or vertical-to-horizontal attenuation models were found in the literature, although the vertical response of structures is used in practice and included in design codes. Nevertheless, it seems to be a trend to pay more attention to this model. There was also found to be a lack of GMPEs for vertical response spectra applicable to subduction interplate earthquakes for a large range of distances and the region under study. Therefore, an attenuation model for interplate earthquakes was developed for distances up to around 400 km and Mw from {\~{}}5 to 8. The model could be useful for probabilistic seismic-hazard assessment and as an aid for code writers.},

The intrinsic variability of the 62 interval slip rates on these normal faults is assessed by normalizing the long-term slip rate of each fault to 0.1 mm/yr. The cumulative density function of the grouped data predicts that, given a mean net slip rate of 0.12 mm/yr, extreme slip rates with 10{\%} and 5{\%} probability of exceedance are 0.51 and 0.92 mm/yr, respectively. These slip rates are considerably higher than those chosen by an expert panel for the Pajarito Fault, New Mexico, which has a long-term mean slip rate of ca. 0.12 mm/yr.},

abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

abstract = {The Kutch region of Gujarat in India is the locale of one of the most devastating earthquake of magnitude (Mw) 7.7, which occurred on January 26, 2001. Though, the region is considered as seismically active region, very few strong motion records are available in this region. First part of this paper uses available data of strong motion earthquakes recorded in this region between 2006 and 2008 years to prepare attenuation relation. The developed attenuation relation is further used to prepare synthetic strong motion records of large magnitude earthquakes using semiempirical simulation technique. Semiempirical simulation technique uses attenuation relation to simulate strong ground motion records of any target earthquake. The database of peak ground acceleration obtained from simulated records is used together with database of peak ground acceleration obtained from observed record to develop following hybrid attenuation model of wide applicability in the Kutch region:, In the above equation, PGA is maximum horizontal ground acceleration in gal, Mw is moment magnitude of earthquake, R is hypocentral distance, and E is epicentral distance in km. The standard deviation of residual of error in this relation is 0.5. This relation is compared with other available relations in this region, and it is seen that developed relation gives minimum root mean square error in comparison with observed and calculated peak ground acceleration from same data set. The applicability of developed relation is further checked by testing it with the observed peak ground acceleration from earthquakes of magnitude (Mw), 3.6, 4.0, 4.4, and 7.7, respectively, which are not included in the database used for regression analysis. The comparison demonstrates the efficacy of developed hybrid attenuation model for calculating peak ground acceleration values in the Kutch region. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Standard errors of earthquake magnitudes are routinely calculated and vary appreciably between earthquakes. However, the uncertainties of magnitude determination are usually ignored in regression models of strong ground motion as a function of magnitude and distance from the earthquake source. This practice has the potential to bias estimates of strong ground motion. A method is given for taking account of the uncertainty of each magnitude determination in fitting such models. It extends previous methods in which the error variance is partitioned into between-earthquake and within-earthquake components. It allows for further decomposition of the between-earthquake component into a part attributable to magnitude uncertainties and a part attributable to other causes. The method has been applied to the well-known attenuation data of Joyner and Boore (1981). The Mw determinations in this dataset fall into two subsets with distinctly different levels of precision, namely, those determined directly and those inferred from values of ML. It is shown that most of the between-earthquake component of variance can be attributed to the relatively low precision of the magnitudes in the latter subset.},

abstract = {The presence of deep unconsolidated deposits in the Upper Mississippi Embayment (UME) has an important impact on surface motions and has been the subject of several studies including a study by two of us, who integrated probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) with nonlinear site effects (NL). This study extends the PSHA-NL procedure to (1) incorporate a finite-fault model capable of generating near-source motions instead of using point-source models only, (2) better approximate the range of available attenuation relations for the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), (3) examine the hazard at very high levels of shaking, and (4) propagate generated rock motions through randomized soil profile properties to achieve a more consistent probabilistic procedure. The extended PSHA-NL procedure is used to develop updated depth-dependent site coefficients for the UME, which generally provides a lower hazard at short periods but a higher hazard at longer periods than current approaches. Proposed probabilistic seismic hazard maps, at selected spectral accelerations, that incorporate the proposed site effects are also presented for the UME and are systematically compared with seismic hazard maps proposed by others.},

abstract = {Estimation of the covariance structure of spatial processes is a fundamental prerequisite for problems of spatial interpolation and the design of monitoring networks. We introduce a nonparametric approach to global estimation of the spatial covariance structure of a random function Z(x, t) observed repeatedly at times ti (i = 1, ⋯, T) at a finite number of sampling stations xi (i = 1, 2, ..., N) in the plane. Our analyses assume temporal stationarity but do not assume spatial stationarity (or isotropy). We analyze the spatial dispersions {\$}\backslashoperatorname{\{}var{\}}(Z(x{\_}i, t) - Z(x{\_}j, t)){\$} as a natural metric for the spatial covariance structure and model these as a general smooth function of the geographic coordinate of station pairs (xi, xj). The model is constructed in two steps. First, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) we compute a two-dimensional representation of the sampling stations for which a monotone function of interpoint distances $\delta$ij approximates the spatial dispersions. MDS transforms the problem into one for which the covariance structure, expressed in terms of spatial dispersions, is stationary and isotropic. Second, we compute thinplate splines to provide smooth mappings of the geographic representation of the sampling stations into their MDS representation. The composition of this mapping f and a monotone function g derived from MDS yields a nonparametric estimator of {\$}\backslashoperatorname{\{}var{\}}(Z(x{\_}a, t) - Z(x{\_}b, t)){\$} for any two geographic locations xa and xb (monitored or not) of the form g(∣ f(xa) - f(xb(∣). By restricting the monotone function g to a class of conditionally nonpositive definite variogram functions, we ensure that the resulting nonparametric model corresponds to a nonnegative definite covariance model. We use biorthogonal grids, introduced by Bookstein in the field of morphometrics, to depict the thin-plate spline mappings that embody the nature of the anisotropy and nonstationarity in the sample covariance matrix. An analysis of mesoscale variability in solar radiation monitored in southwestern British Columbia demonstrates this methodology.},

abstract = {CyberShake, as part of the Southern California Earthquake Center's (SCEC) Community Modeling Environment, is developing a methodology that explicitly incorporates deterministic source and wave propagation effects within seismic hazard calculations through the use of physics-based 3D ground motion simulations. To calculate a waveform-based seismic hazard estimate for a site of interest, we begin with Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2.0 (UCERF2.0) and identify all ruptures within 200 km of the site of interest. We convert the UCERF2.0 rupture definition into multiple rupture variations with differing hypocenter locations and slip distributions, resulting in about 415,000 rupture variations per site. Strain Green Tensors are calculated for the site of interest using the SCEC Community Velocity Model, Version 4 (CVM4), and then, using reciprocity, we calculate synthetic seismograms for each rupture variation. Peak intensity measures are then extracted from these synthetics and combined with the original rupture probabilities to produce probabilistic seismic hazard curves for the site. Being explicitly site-based, CyberShake directly samples the ground motion variability at that site over many earthquake cycles (i.e., rupture scenarios) and alleviates the need for the ergodic assumption that is implicitly included in traditional empirically based calculations. Thus far, we have simulated ruptures at over 200 sites in the Los Angeles region for ground shaking periods of 2 s and longer, providing the basis for the first generation CyberShake hazard maps. Our results indicate that the combination of rupture directivity and basin response effects can lead to an increase in the hazard level for some sites, relative to that given by a conventional Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE). Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we find that the physics-based hazard results are much more sensitive to the assumed magnitude-area relations and magnitude uncertainty estimates used in the definition of the ruptures than is found in the traditional GMPE approach. This reinforces the need for continued development of a better understanding of earthquake source characterization and the constitutive relations that govern the earthquake rupture process.},

The amount and quality of data used allowed us to measure relevant amplification characteristics. For all earthquakes, the ratios are relatively constant regardless the magnitude, epicentral distance and azimuth of subduction and normal faulting earthquakes. With data recorded at Station Central de Abastos, it is shown that these ratios are a much better approach than horizontal to vertical ratios, which yield only a rough estimation of site amplification. Also for Central de Abastos, where little nonlinear behavior has been observed, an empirical approximation is used to account for these effects. We also built maps of equal amplification that exhibit those zones that have experienced damage during earthquakes and those at the highest risk. The ratios presented here are useful and reliable to accurately predict the amplification of motion.},

abstract = {Sander Greenland and Charles Poole 1 accept that P values are here to stay but recognize that some of their most common interpretations have problems. The casual view of the P value as posterior probability of the truth of the null hypothesis is false and not even close to valid under any reasonable model, yet this misunderstanding persists even in high-stakes settings (as discussed, for example, by Greenland in 2011).2 The formal view of the P value as a probability conditional on the null is mathematically correct but typically irrelevant to research goals (hence, the popularity of alternative--if wrong--interpretations). A Bayesian interpretation based on a spike-and-slab model makes little sense in applied contexts in epidemiology, political science, and other fields in which true effects are typically nonzero and bounded (thus violating both the “spike” and the “slab” parts of the model).},

@article{Bose2010,
abstract = {Earthquake EarlyWarning (EEW) predicts future ground shaking based on presently available data. Long ruptures present the best opportunities for EEW since many heavily shaken areas are distant from the earthquake epicentre and may receive long warning times. Predicting the shaking from large earthquakes, however, requires some estimate of the likelihood of the future evolution of an ongoing rupture. An EEW system that anticipates future rupture using the present magnitude (or rupture length) together with the Gutenberg-Richter frequency- size statistics will likely never predict a large earthquake, because of the rare occurrence of ‘extreme events'. However, it seems reasonable to assume that large slip amplitudes increase the probability for evolving into a large earthquake. To investigate the relationship between the slip and the eventual size of an ongoing rupture, we simulate suites of 1-D rupture series from stochastic models of spatially heterogeneous slip. We find that while large slip amplitudes increase the probability for the continuation of a rupture and the possible evolution into a ‘Big One', the recognition that rupture is occurring on a spatially smooth fault has an even stronger effect.We conclude that anEEWsystem for large earthquakes needs some mechanism for the rapid recognition of the causative fault (e.g., from real-time GPS measurements) and consideration of its ‘smoothness'. An EEW system for large earthquakes on smooth faults, such as the San Andreas Fault, could be implemented in two ways: the system could issue a warning, whenever slip on the fault exceeds a few metres, because the probability for a large earthquake is high and strong shaking is expected to occur in large areas around the fault. Amore sophisticated EEW system could use the present slip on the fault to estimate the future slip evolution and final rupture dimensions, and (using this information) could provide probabilistic predictions of seismic ground motions along the evolving rupture. The decision on whether an EEW system should be realized in the first or in the second way (or in a combination of both) is user-specific.},

The results are in terms of a ground motion parameter (such as peak acceleration) versus average return period. The method incorporates the influence of all potential sources of earthquakes and the average activity rates assigned to them. Arbitrary geographical relationships between the site and po- tential point, line, or areal sources can be modeled with computational ease. In the range of interest, the derived distributions of maximum annual ground motions are in the form of Type I or Type II extreme value distributions, if the more com- monly assumed magnitude distribution and attenuation laws are used.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Grace Scientific Publishing, LLC. Sampling from a truncated multivariate distribution subject to multiple linear inequality constraints is a recurring problem in many areas in statistics and econometrics, such as the order-restricted regressions, censored data models, and shape-restricted nonparametric regressions. However, the sampling problem remains nontrivial due to the analytically intractable normalizing constant of the truncated multivariate distribution. We first develop an efficient rejection sampling method for the truncated univariate normal distribution, and analytically establish its superiority in terms of acceptance rates compared to some of the popular existing methods. We then extend our methodology to obtain samples from a truncated multivariate normal distribution subject to convex polytope restriction regions. Finally, we generalize the sampling method to truncated scale mixtures of multivariate normal distributions. Empirical results are presented to illustrate the superior performance of our proposed Gibbs sampler in terms of various criteria (e.g., mixing and integrated auto-correlation time).},

abstract = {Homogenization of earthquake catalog being a pre-requisite for seismic hazard assessment requires region based magnitude conversion relationships. Linear Standard Regression (SR) relations fail when both the magnitudes have measurement errors. To accomplish homogenization, techniques like Orthogonal Standard Regression (OSR) are thus used. In this paper a technique is proposed for using such OSR for preparation of homogenized earthquake catalog in moment magnitude M w.For derivation of orthogonal regression relation between m b and M w, a data set consisting of 171 events with observed body wave magnitudes (m b,obs) and moment magnitude (M w,obs) values has been taken from ISC and GCMT databases for Northeast India and adjoining region for the period 1978-2006. Firstly, an OSR relation given below has been developed using m b,obs and M w,obs values corresponding to 150 events from this data set. M w=1.3(±0.004)m b,proxy-1.4(±0.130), where m b,proxy are body wave magnitude values of the points on the OSR line given by the orthogonality criterion, for observed (m b,obs, M w,obs) points. A linear relation is then developed between these 150 m b,obs values and corresponding m b,proxy values given by the OSR line using orthogonality criterion. The relation obtained is m b,proxy=0.878(±0.03)m b,obs+0.653(±0.15).The accuracy of the above procedure has been checked with the rest of the data i.e., 21 events values. The improvement in the correlation coefficient value between m b,obs and M w estimated using the proposed procedure compared to the correlation coefficient value between m b,obs and M w,obs shows the advantage of OSR relationship for homogenization.The OSR procedure developed in this study can be used to homogenize any catalog containing various magnitudes (e.g., M L, m b, M S) with measurement errors, by their conversion to unified moment magnitude M w. The proposed procedure also remains valid in case the magnitudes have measurement errors of different orders, i.e. the error variance ratio is different from unity. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {There are difficulties with probability as a representation of uncertainty. However, we argue that there is an important distinction between principle and practice. In principle, probability is uniquely appropriate for the representation and quantification of all forms of uncertainty; it is in this sense that we claim that 'probability is perfect'. In practice, people find it difficult to express their knowledge and beliefs in probabilistic form, so that elicitation of probability distributions is a far from perfect process. We therefore argue that there is no need for alternative theories, but that any practical elicitation of expert knowledge must fully acknowledge imprecision in the resulting distribution. We outline a recently developed Bayesian technique that allows the imprecision in elicitation to be formulated explicitly, and apply it to some of the challenge problems. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Strong ground motion close to a fault can be expected to be very large, so its estimation is essential for human safety. Although a few strong-motion data exist for the west Eurasian region, we proposed in a previous work [Berge-Thierry et al., 2003] an attenuation relation for spectral acceleration using strong-motion data recorded in west Eurasia (mainly in Europe) and some in the western United States: this relationship was derived for the French Safety Rule, which is applied for seismic hazard assessment at nuclear power plants. In this study, we propose a constraining of the amplitude saturation term related to the proximity of the fault, and an adding of an amplitude saturation term in the regression model. We add, to the data-set previously used to derive the west Eurasian attenuation relationship strong-motions recorded during recent large earthquakes: the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu (Kobe) event in Japan and the 1999 Kocaeli (Izmit) event in Turkey. The regression analysis, adopted from Pukushima and Tanaka [1990], is non-linear, so an iterative procedure is applied. The determined regression coefficients lead to a prediction of a peak ground acceleration of about 0.7g for soil site conditions at a fault distance of 0.5 km. The Q coefficient deduced from the distance coefficient is in agreement with scattering Q models. The introduction of the saturation term leads to significantly lower predictions of average spectral accelerations at short distances as compared with using the Berge-Thierry et al. [2003] empirical model.},

@article{Kuehn2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. A partially non-ergodic ground-motion prediction equation is estimated for Europe and the Middle East. Therefore, a hierarchical model is presented that accounts for regional differences. For this purpose, the scaling of ground-motion intensity measures is assumed to be similar, but not identical in different regions. This is achieved by assuming a hierarchical model, where some coefficients are treated as random variables which are sampled from an underlying global distribution. The coefficients are estimated by Bayesian inference. This allows one to estimate the epistemic uncertainty in the coefficients, and consequently in model predictions, in a rigorous way. The model is estimated based on peak ground acceleration data from nine different European/Middle Eastern regions. There are large differences in the amount of earthquakes and records in the different regions. However, due to the hierarchical nature of the model, regions with only few data points borrow strength from other regions with more data. This makes it possible to estimate a separate set of coefficients for all regions. Different regionalized models are compared, for which different coefficients are assumed to be regionally dependent. Results show that regionalizing the coefficients for magnitude and distance scaling leads to better performance of the models. The models for all regions are physically sound, even if only very few earthquakes comprise one region.},

abstract = {This manuscript provides a critical examination of the ground motions recorded in the near-source region resulting from the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Particular attention is given to reconciling the observed spatial distribution of ground motions in terms of physical phenomena related to source, path and site effects. The large number of near-source observed strong ground motions show clear evidence of: forward-directivity, basin generated surface waves, liquefaction and other significant nonlinear site response. The pseudo-acceleration response spectra (SA) amplitudes and significant duration of strong motions agree well with empirical prediction models, except at long vibration periods where the influence of basin-generated surface waves and nonlinear site response are significant and not adequately accounted for in empirical SA models. Pseudo-acceleration response spectra are also compared with those observed in the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake and routine design response spectra used in order to emphasise the amplitude of ground shaking and elucidate the importance of local geotechnical characteristics on surface ground motions. The characteristics of the observed vertical component accelerations are shown to be strongly dependent on source-to-site distance and are comparable with those from the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake, implying the large amplitudes observed are simply a result of many observations at close distances rather than a peculiar source effect.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We compute LOO using Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {Most of earthquake early warning systems are conceived as either regional or on-site systems. A new concept is the integration of these approaches for the definition of alert levels and the estimation of the earthquake Potential Damage Zone (PDZ). The key element of the method is the real-time, simultaneous measurement of initial peak displacement (Pd) and period parameter (TAUc) for a 3-second window after the first P-arrival time at accelerometer stations located at increasing distances from the epicenter. As for the on-site approach the recorded values of Pd and TAUc are compared to threshold values, which are set for a minimum magnitude Mw 6 and instrumental intensity Imm VII, according to empirical regression analysis of strong motion data from different seismic regions. At each recording site the alert level is assigned based on a decisional table with four entries defined by critical values of the parameters Pd and TAUc. A regional network of stations provides the event location and transmits the information about the alert levels recorded at near-source stations to more distant sites, before the arrival of the most destructive phase. We present the results of performance tests of this method using ten, Mw {\textgreater} 6 Japanese earthquakes, and propose a very robust methodology for mapping the PDZ in the first seconds after a moderate-to-large earthquake. The studied cases displayed a very good matching between the rapidly predicted and observed damage zone, the latter being mapped a few days after the event from detailed macro-seismic surveys.},

abstract = {We introduce a method for learning Bayesian networks that handles the discretization of continuous variables as an integral part of the learning process. We formally derive a criterion based on the Minimal Description Length principle for choosing the threshold values for the discretization. This new metric embodies a tradeoff between the complexity of the learned discretization, the complexity of the Bayesian network, and the fitness of the network as a model of the training data. This metric has the attractive property of decomposition: the discretization of each variable depends only on the interactions between the variable and its local neighborhood in the network. We examine other properties of this metric that are relevant to the computation of a discretization policy and propose an iterative algorithm for learning a policy. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the discretization in applications to both supervised and unsupervised learning.},

abstract = {Horizontal‐component response spectra data for ground motions recorded on hard‐rock sites in eastern North America (ENA) are used to explore the aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in ground‐motion prediction equations (GMPEs). An all‐station sigma, expressing the total calculated scatter of values about a GMPE, ranges from 0.25 to 0.29log10 unit. Single‐station sigmas, in which the scatter is evaluated station by station relative to a regional GMPE, average in the range of 0.23–0.28. The scatter of observations about site‐specific GMPEs (GMPEs developed from multiple events recorded at a single station), which comes the closest to measuring the actual aleatory variability, has average values of 0.22–0.26. Overall, aleatory variability of ground motions in ENA is no larger than that for California, at least for moderate events recorded on hard‐rock sites. Epistemic uncertainty is considered by looking at the standard deviation of GMPEs developed separately for each station (i.e., the scatter of predictions rather than the scatter of observations). This exercise suggests that the overall epistemic uncertainty in ENA GMPEs should be at least 0.15 log unit (as a standard deviation of the median GMPEs) in the magnitude–distance range in which the prediction equations can be anchored by empirical data (magnitude {\textless}5.5, distances {\textgreater}50 km). It should be larger than 0.15 unit at large magnitudes and close distances.},

abstract = {From 2000 to 2004 a large scale probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PEGASOS) was created and performed as a research project, sponsored by the Swiss NPP utilities to improve the assessment methodology for seismic risk in support of the plant-specific seismic PRAs. The project followed the methodology of the SSHAC [Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee (SSHAC), 1997. Recommendations for Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis: Guidance on Uncertainty and Use of Experts. NU-REG/ CR-6372 ] procedures at its most elaborate way-level 4. Before practical implementation was to occur, a detailed review was performed including validation tests and analysis of uncertainty propagation. This paper presents the main results of the review. The review revealed that current PSHA (Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis) methodology as based on logic trees, in conjunction with the SSHAC procedures, potentially leads to a significant overestimation of the seismic hazard in areas with low seismic activity due to the inherent possibilities of unconstrained accumulation of uncertainties. The preliminary results of the project did not pass any of our logical geological-scientific benchmark tests used in our attempts to perform a validation process of the PEGASOS analysis method. Some of the problems encountered are of generic nature and shall be studied carefully before making the decision of whether or not the Swiss nuclear power industry will adopt the recommended use of SSHAC-procedures as a basis for the evaluation of the seismic hazard for individual nuclear power plant seismic PRA without correction. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This is the second volume of philosophical essays by one of the most innovative and influential philosophers now writing in English. Containing thirteen papers in all, the book includes both new essays and previously published papers, some of them with extensive new postscripts reflecting Lewis's current thinking. The papers in Volume II focus on causation and several other closely related topics, including counterfactual and indicative conditionals, the direction of time, subjective and objective probability, causation, explanation, perception, free will, and rational decision. Throughout, Lewis analyzes global features of the world in such a way as to show that they might turn out to supervene on the spatiotemporal arrangement of local qualities.},

abstract = {Spatial correlation models of peak ground motions and response spectra are key components for extending current probabilistic seismic hazard and risk analysis for a single location into those for multiple locations and facilitate broad applications, including seismic loss estimation of spatially distributed buildings and infrastructure and ShakeMap interpolation. One of the important aspects that has not been investigated thoroughly is interevent variability of the spatial correlation among different seismic events. The current study addresses this issue. For this purpose, a consolidated extensive ground-motion database was constructed; more than 9000 records from 41 well-recorded earthquakes were used. The analysis results indicate that the extent of the spatial correlation variability, which needs to be incorporated in seismic-hazard and risk calculations, is approximately {\{}+/-{\}}0.1 units with respect to a typical spatial correlation model.},

abstract = {A collection of ground-motion recordings (1070 acceleration records) of moderate (5.1 less than or equal to M-L less than or equal to 6.5) earthquakes obtained during the execution of the Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) since 1991 was used to study source scaling model and attenuation relations for a wide range of earthquake magnitudes and distances and to verify the models developed recently for the Taiwan region. The results of the analysis reveal that the acceleration spectra of the most significant part of the records, starting from S-wave arrival, can be modelled accurately using the Prune's omega-squared source model with magnitude-dependent stress parameter Delta sigma, that should be determined using the recently proposed regional relationships between magnitude (M-L) and seismic moment (M-o) and between M-o and Delta sigma. The anelastic attenuation Q of spectral amplitudes with distance may be described as Q = 225 f(1.1) both for deep (depth more than 35 km) and shallow earthquakes. The source scaling and attenuation models allow a satisfactory prediction of the peak ground acceleration for magnitudes 5.1 less than or equal to M less than or equal to 6.5 and distances up to about 200 km in the Taiwan region, and may be useful for seismic hazard assessment.

@article{Teh2006,
abstract = {We consider problems involving groups of data where each observation within a group is a draw from a mixture model and where it is desirable to share mixture components between groups. We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the “Chinese restaurant franchise.” We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling.},

@article{Lanzano2017,
abstract = {In this paper, we separate the residuals of ground motion prediction equations into different components, calculating the repeatable site-specific ( {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta S2S{\_}{\{}s{\}}{\$}{\$} {\$}\delta{\$} S 2 S s ), location-specific ( {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta L2L{\_}{\{}r{\}}{\$}{\$} {\$}\delta{\$} L 2 L r ) and path-specific ( {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta P2P{\_}{\{}er{\}}{\$}{\$} {\$}\delta{\$} P 2 P e r ) correction for the median model. In this way, we can reduce the total standard deviation (sigma) of the ground-motion model by Lanzano et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 106(1):73--92, 2016), removing these components and overcome the ergodic assumption. These repeatable terms are empirically estimated using a dataset composed by acceleration waveforms of Italian events mainly occurred in the Po plain and Eastern Alps (Northern Italy), in the time interval 1976--2015. The analysis is carried out on 2241 recordings, from 88 shallow earthquakes recorded by 168 sites. A local model, specifically tailored for Northern Italy, is used as the reference GMPE, which predicts the geometric mean of the horizontal peak ground accelerations and response spectral ordinates in the period range 0.04--4 s. Because most of the propagation paths sampled only once, the path-specific components and the resulting aleatory variability are also calculated from the spatial correlation of residuals, following the approach of Lin et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 101(5):2281--2295, 2011). We find a significant reduction of the overall ground motion variability to an extent comparable to what observed from previous studies on empirical and simulated datasets. The estimated median corrections and variance components can be used in probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for a single site and a single path in Northern Italy. As an example, we compute the hazard curves at some sites by means of three different approaches (ergodic, partially non-ergodic and full non-ergodic), in order to quantify the impact of relaxing the ergodic assumption.},
