abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size e and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter e on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Matthew D.

Several Bayesian variable selection methods have been developed, and we concentrate on the following methods: Kuo {\&} Mallick, Gibbs Variable Selection (GVS), Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), adaptive shrinkage with Je{\AE}reys' prior or a Laplacian prior, and reversible jump MCMC. We review these methods, in the context of their di{\AE}erent properties. We then implement the methods in BUGS, using both real and simulated data as examples, and investigate how the di{\AE}erent methods perform in practice. Our results suggest that SSVS, reversible jump MCMC and adaptive shrinkage methods can all work well, but the choice of which method is better will depend on the priors that are used, and also on how they are implemented.},

abstract = {Models of the Santa Clara Valley (SCV) 3D velocity structure and 3D finite-difference software are used to predict ground motions from scenario earthquakes on the San Andreas (SAF), Monte Vista/Shannon, South Hayward, and Calaveras faults. Twenty different scenario ruptures are considered that explore different source models with alternative hypocenters, fault dimensions, and rupture velocities and three different velocity models. Ground motion from the full wave field up to 1 Hz is exhibited as maps of peak horizontal velocity and pseudospectral acceleration at periods of 1, 3, and 5 sec. Basin edge effects and amplification in sedimentary basins of the SCV are observed that exhibit effects from shallow sediments with relatively low shear-wave velocity (330 m/sec). Scenario earthquakes have been simulated for events with the following magnitudes: (1) M 6.8-7.4 Calaveras sources, (2) M 6.7-6.9 South Hayward sources, (3) M 6.7 Monte Vista/Shannon sources, and (4) M 7.1-7.2 Peninsula segment of the SAF sources. Ground motions are strongly influenced by source parameters such as rupture velocity, rise time, maximum depth of rupture, hypocenter, and source directivity. Cenozoic basins also exert a strong influence on ground motion. For example, the Evergreen Basin on the northeastern side of the SCV is especially responsive to 3-5-sec energy from most scenario earthquakes. The Cupertino Basin on the southwestern edge of the SCV tends to be highly excited by many Peninsula and Monte Vista fault scenarios. Sites over the interior of the Evergreen Basin can have long-duration coda that reflect the trapping of seismic energy within this basin. Plausible scenarios produce predominantly 5-sec wave trains with greater than 30 cm/sec sustained ground-motion amplitude with greater than 30 sec duration within the Evergreen Basin.},

abstract = {Geostatistical models have traditionally been stationary. However, physical knowledge about underlying spatial processes often requires models with non-stationary dependence structures. Thus, there has been an interest in the literature to provide flexible models and computationally efficient methods for non-stationary phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to spatial modelling provides a flexible class of non-stationary models where explanatory variables can be easily included in the dependence structure. In addition, the SPDE approach enables computationally efficient Bayesian inference with integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) available through the R-package r-inla. We illustrate the suggested modelling framework with a case study of annual precipitation in southern Norway, and compare a non-stationary model with dependence structure governed by elevation to a stationary model. Further, we use a simulation study to explore the annual precipitation models. We investigate identifiability of model parameters and whether the deviance information criterion (DIC) is able to distinguish datasets from the non-stationary and stationary models.},

As exact cross-validation is often practically infeasible for Bayesian models because it requires too much time, approximate cross-validation methods have been developed; most notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). However, standard LOO-CV requires the likelihood to be factorizable, that is the observations have to be conditionally independent given the model parameters. Unfortunately, some important statistical models most notably in the context of temporal and spatial statistics are non-factorizable, but LOO-CV may still be an important measure for these models. For this reason, we derive how to compute and validate exact and approximate LOO-CV for non-factorizable models that follow a multivariate normal likelihood.},

abstract = {To scale Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets we introduce the robust Bayesian Committee Machine (rBCM), a practical and scalable product-of-experts model for large-scale distributed GP regression. Unlike state-of-the-art sparse GP approximations, the rBCM is conceptually simple and does not rely on inducing or variational parameters. The key idea is to recursively distribute computations to independent computational units and, subsequently, recombine them to form an overall result. Efficient closed-form inference allows for straightforward parallelisation and distributed computations with a small memory footprint. The rBCM is independent of the computational graph and can be used on heterogeneous computing infrastructures, ranging from laptops to clusters. With sufficient computing resources our distributed GP model can handle arbitrarily large data sets.},

@article{Griffin2020,
abstract = {The 2018 National Seismic Hazard Assessment of Australia incorporated 19 alternative seismic‐source models developed by members of the Australian seismological community. The diversity of these models demonstrates the deep epistemic uncertainty that exists with regards to how best to characterize seismicity in stable continental regions. In the face of similarly high uncertainty, a diverse range of ground‐motion models was proposed for use. A complex logic tree was developed to incorporate the alternative component models into a single hazard model. Expert opinion was drawn upon to weight the alternative logic‐tree branches through a structured expert elicitation process. Expert elicitation aims to transparently and reproducibly characterize the community distribution of expert estimates for uncertain quantities and thereby quantify the epistemic uncertainty around estimates of seismic hazard in Australia. We achieve a multimodel rational consensus in which each model, and each expert, is, in accordance with the Australian cultural myth of egalitarianism, given a “fair go”—that is, judged on their merits rather than their status. Yet despite this process, we find that the results are not universally accepted. A key issue is a contested boundary between what is scientifically reducible and what remains epistemologically uncertain, with a particular focus on the earthquake catalog. Furthermore, a reduction, on average, of 72{\%} for the 10{\%} in 50 yr probability of exceedance peak ground acceleration levels compared with those underpinning existing building design standards, challenges the choice of metrics upon which design codes are based. Both quantification of the bounds of epistemic uncertainties through expert elicitation and reduction of epistemic uncertainties through scientific advances have changed our understanding of how the hazard behaves. Dialog between scientists, engineers, and policy makers is required to ensure that as our understanding of the hazard evolves, the hazard metrics used to underpin risk management decisions are re‐evaluated to ensure societal aims are achieved.},

abstract = {Spatial process models for analyzing geostatistical data entail computations that become prohibitive as the number of spatial locations become large. This manuscript develops a class of highly scalable Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP) models to provide fully model-based inference for large geostatistical datasets. We establish that the NNGP is a well-defined spatial process providing legitimate finite-dimensional Gaussian densities with sparse precision matrices. We embed the NNGP as a sparsity-inducing prior within a rich hierarchical modeling framework and outline how computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be executed without storing or decomposing large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations, thereby rendering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of the NNGP over competing methods using simulation studies and also analyze forest biomass from a massive United States Forest Inventory dataset at a scale that precludes alternative dimension-reducing methods.},

abstract = {This work brings together two powerful concepts in Gaussian processes: the variational approach to sparse approximation and the spectral representation of Gaussian processes. This gives rise to an approximation that inherits the benefits of the variational approach but with the representational power and computational scalability of spectral representations. The work hinges on a key result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances. We derive these expressions for Matern kernels in one dimension, and generalize to more dimensions using kernels with specific structures. Under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise, our method requires only a single pass through the dataset, making for very fast and accurate computation. We fit a model to 4 million training points in just a few minutes on a standard laptop. With non-conjugate likelihoods, our MCMC scheme reduces the cost of computation from O(NM2) (for a sparse Gaussian process) to O(NM) per iteration, where N is the number of data and M is the number of features.},

@article{Beauval2012,
abstract = {Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPE) are essential in probabilistic seismic hazard studies for estimating the ground motions generated by the seismic sources. In low-seismicity regions, only weak motions are available during the lifetime of accelerometric networks, and the equations selected for the probabilistic studies are usually models established from foreign data. Although most GMPEs have been developed for magnitudes 5 and above, the minimum magnitude often used in probabilistic studies in low-seismicity regions is smaller. Disaggregations have shown that, at return periods of engineering interest, magnitudes less than 5 may be contributing to the hazard. This paper presents the testing of several GMPEs selected in current international and national probabilistic projects against weak motions recorded in France (191 recordings with source-site distances up to 300 km, 3:8≤ M w ≤4:5). The method is based on the log-likelihood value proposed by Scherbaum et al. (2009). The best-fitting models (approximately 2:5 ≤ LLH ≤ 3:5) over the whole frequency range are the Cauzzi and Faccioli (2008), Akkar and Bommer (2010), and Abrahamson and Silva (2008) models. No significant regional variation of ground motions is highlighted, and the magnitude scaling could be the predominant factor in the control of ground-motion amplitudes. Furthermore, we take advantage of a rich Japanese dataset to run tests on randomly selected low-magnitude subsets, and confirm that a dataset of {\~{}}190 observations, the same size as the French dataset, is large enough to obtain stable LLH estimates. Additionally we perform the tests against larger magnitudes (5-7) from the Japanese dataset. The ranking of models is partially modified, indicating a magnitude scaling effect for some of the models, and showing that extrapolating testing results obtained from low-magnitude ranges to higher magnitude ranges is not straightforward.},

However, fitting complex models to large data is a bottleneck in this process. Deriving algorithms for new models can be both mathematically and computationally challenging, which makes it difficult to efficiently cycle through the steps. To this end, we develop automatic differentiation variational inference (advi). Using our method, the scientist only provides a probabilistic model and a dataset, nothing else. advi automatically derives an efficient variational inference algorithm, freeing the scientist to refine and explore many models. advi supports a broad class of models-no conjugacy assumptions are required.

Expanding on previous work (Roederer, 1979,1982) three possibly concurrent factors will be examined: (1) The inborn motivation to train language-handling networks of the brain in the processing of simple, organized sound patterns as a prelude to the acquisition of language; (2) The need to extract the information contained in the "musical" components of speech; (3) The value of music as a means of transmitting information on emotional states and its effect in congregating and behaviorally equalizing masses of people. In the discussion, special attention will be paid to the role of motivation and emotion in auditory perception, to the fact that in humans limbic system functions can be activated by internally evoked images in complete detachment from the current state of environment and organism, and to the existence of two distinct strategies of cerebral information processing, namely short-term time sequencing, as required in speech communication and thinking, and holistic pattern recognition, as required in music perception.},

abstract = {The Chi-Chi earthquake occurred at 17:47 on 20 September 1999 and is the largest earthquake (M-W 7.6) to have occurred on land in Taiwan in the twentieth century. This earthquake caused considerable damage and was named the "921 Chi-Chi Great Earthquake" by the Taiwan government, as the local date was 21 September. Because an extensive strong-motion instrumentation program in Taiwan was completed by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) in 1996, over 30,000 digital strong-motion records have been obtained from the Chi-Chi earthquake and thousands of its aftershocks. These records form the largest set of strong-motion data recorded from a major earthquake since strong-motion seismology studies began in the 1930s. This data set is important to seismology and earthquake engineering because it includes over 60 recording sites within 20 km of the fault ruptures, which provides a five-fold increase of such near-field records available for the entire world. A prepublication CD was made available in mid-December 1999, and the data on it have been used by many authors in dozens of articles published so far. Since then, we examined about 10,000 strong-motion records and conducted a first-order quality assurance procedure for all the records obtained on 20 September 1999, including the mainshock and hundreds of the early aftershocks. We performed extensive data processing for quality assurance and selected a total of 663 strong-motion data files from 441 accelerographs to construct strong-motion records up to 4-min long for the mainshock whenever possible. In this article, we present a brief description of the processed acceleration data from the Chi-Chi earthquake. The data set (about 500 megabytes) and an extensive 562-page report (documenting the data processing and results of the processed data) are archived on the attached CD in this Special Issue so that users can quickly access this valuable data set for their research.},

abstract = {Living in Christchurch and working in a community psychiatric team after the 7.1 MM intensity earthquake on 4 September 2010 provided the opportunity to examine the psychiatric literature on earthquakes and make some naturalistic observations about anxiety and earthquakes, with a particular focus on the impact of aftershocks. Literature search of articles were varied in nature but mostly commented on service delivery and the mental health consequences of a natural disaster. The period after an earthquake, when aftershocks were occurring, was associated with a further increase in blood pressure in a group of elderly outpatients with hypertension. There is additional literature examining the effects of earthquakes on coronary artery disease with an acute increase in coronary syndromes occurring on the day of major earthquakes, as well as in the years subsequently. The literature on earthquakes and aftershocks suggests that these events cause significant short and long-term mental and physical problems. This is consistent with observations in the Christchurch setting where the initial quake appeared to have a triggering effect and the uncertainty about aftershocks exacerbated frayed nerves and may have longer-term impacts on well-being.

abstract = {We assessed the applicability of several ground‐motion models (GMMs) against Iran's local data. Candidate GMMs are selected from those developed for shallow crustal regions such as Iran, Turkey, Japan, Europe and the Middle East, and the western United States. We made the evaluation database prospective to all candidate GMMs to assess their predictive capability. The evaluation database is composed of 643 records from 240 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 3.9 to 7.3 and Joyner–Boore distances up to 300 km. We implemented the log‐likelihood method of Scherbaum et al. (2009), the Euclidean distance‐based ranking proposed by Kale and Akkar (2013), and the multivariate logarithmic score of Mak et al. (2017) to evaluate the candidate models. We ranked GMMs by paying attention to the issue of score variability. To assess the score variability, we generated resampled datasets from the whole database using the cluster bootstrap technique and ranked models based on their relative performance among bootstrap samples. Overall, Sedaghati and Pezeshk (2017), Zafarani et al. (2018), and Farajpour et al. (2019) local models outperform remaining models considering the whole database over the entire frequency range. For high‐seismicity regions, the Zhao et al. (2006) model can be used in line with the first two local models to better quantify epistemic uncertainties associated with the process of model selection. In addition to aforementioned local models, Bindi et al. (2014) show acceptable performance against small‐to‐moderate magnitude data and may be considered for estimating seismic hazard in low‐seismicity regions of Iran.},

abstract = {Proper selection and ranking of Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) is critical for successful logic-tree implementation in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. The present study explores this issue in predicting peak ground accelerations at the rock sites in India. Macroseismic intensity data complemented with limited strong ground-motion recordings are used for the purpose. The findings corroborate the possible conformity between the GMPEs developed for tectonically active shallow crust across the globe. On the other hand, the relevant GMPEs in the intraplate regions cluster into two different groups with the equations of lower ranks catering to higher ground motions. The earthquakes in the subduction zones have significant regional implications. However, affinity in the ground-motion attenuations between the major interface events (M {\^{}}sub W{\^{}}{\textgreater}7.4) in Andaman-Nicobar, Japan and Cascadia, respectively, is noted. This can be also observed for the intraslab events in the Hindukush and Taiwan respectively. Overall, we do not observe any significant advantage with the equations developed using the regional data. These findings are expected to be useful in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis across the study region.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Estimation of stationary dependence structure parameters using only a single realisation of the spatial process, typically leads to inaccurate estimates and poorly identified parameters. A common way to handle this is to fix some of the parameters, or within the Bayesian framework, impose prior knowledge. In many applied settings, stationary models are not flexible enough to model the process of interest, thus non-stationary spatial models are used. However, more flexible models usually means more parameters, and the identifiability problem becomes even more challenging. We investigate aspects of estimation of a Bayesian non-stationary spatial model for annual precipitation using observations from multiple years. The model contains replicates of the spatial field, which increases precision of the estimates and makes them less prior sensitive. Using R-INLA, we analyse precipitation data from southern Norway, and investigate statistical properties of the replicate model in a simulation study. The non-stationary spatial model we explore belongs to a recently introduced class of stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) based spatial models. This model class allows for non-stationary models with explanatory variables in the dependence structure. We derive conditions to facilitate prior specification for these types of non-stationary spatial models.},

abstract = {This short note proposes an improvement to the implementation of uncertainty associated with rupture location from future earthquakes in probabilistic fault displacement hazard analysis. Location uncertainty leads to nonzero primary fault displacement near a mapped fault. With the improved implementation of location uncertainty, estimated fault displacement hazard at a given site is affected strongly by the dimension of the area considered (or the footprint size of the structure). A larger area near a mapped fault has greater potential of exhibiting primary fault displacement than does a smaller area at the same location. In addition, fault displacement hazard is affected by fault‐map quality and fault‐trace complexity. For a more accurately mapped fault with simpler geometry, larger fault displacement is expected directly over and in close proximity of the mapped fault. If fault location is highly uncertain and fault traces are complex, expected displacement is spread out in a wider zone along the mapped fault.},

We determined a base model with moment magnitude and the shortest distance from the source fault as parameters. In order to avoid overestimating amplitude atmagnitude larger than 8, we examined two models – a quadratic magnitude term and a linear magnitude term with a complete amplitude saturation term at someMw. We then adopt additional correction terms corresponding to amplification by deep sediments or shallow soft soils, and anomalous seismic intensity distribution in order to improve prediction.},

abstract = {Gaussian random fields (GRFs) play an important part in spatial modelling, but can be computationally infeasible for general covariance structures. An efficient approach is to specify GRFs via stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and derive Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximations of the solutions. We consider the construction of a class of non-stationary GRFs with varying local anisotropy, where the local anisotropy is introduced by allowing the coefficients in the SPDE to vary with position. This is done by using a form of diffusion equation driven by Gaussian white noise with a spatially varying diffusion matrix. This allows for the introduction of parameters that control the GRF by parametrizing the diffusion matrix. These parameters and the GRF may be considered to be part of a hierarchical model and the parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework. The results show that the use of an SPDE with non-constant coefficients is a promising way of creating non-stationary spatial GMRFs that allow for physical interpretability of the parameters, although there are several remaining challenges that would need to be solved before these models can be put to general practical use.},

abstract = {Subpixel correlation of preevent and postevent air photos reveal the complete near-field, horizontal surface deformation patterns of the 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers and 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine ruptures. Total surface displacement values for both earthquakes are systematically larger than “on-fault” displacements from geologic field surveys, indicating significant distributed, inelastic deformation occurred along these ruptures. Comparison of these two data sets shows that 46 ± 10{\%} and 39 ± 22{\%} of the total surface deformation were distributed over fault zones averaging 154 m and 121 m in width for the Landers and Hector Mine events, respectively. Spatial variations of distributed deformation along both ruptures show correlations with the type of near-surface lithology and degree of fault complexity; larger amounts of distributed shear occur where the rupture propagated through loose unconsolidated sediments and areas of more complex fault structure. These results have basic implications for geologic-geodetic rate comparisons and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.},

@article{VanHoutte2018,
abstract = {For several decades, random vibration theory (RVT) has been a popular method for predicting peak ground motions for seismic hazard assessment. Modern usage of RVT is typically in the stochastic method of simulating peak ground motion, to convert empirical models of the earthquake Fourier amplitude spectrum to response spectra, and in site response analysis. This study reexamines the underlying assumptions of RVT analysis, particularly regarding durations, peak factors, and nonstationarity corrections. It is suggested that the significant oscillator duration is the most appropriate duration metric for predicting response spectra, and an empirical model is derived using New Zealand data. This allows RVT to be easily generalized to levels of oscillator damping other than the usual 5{\%}. For short-duration excitations, signal nonstationarity is accounted for using a theoretical time-dependent power spectral density function. This allows proper consideration of nonstationarity in both the signal standard deviation and the signal bandwidth. The appropriateness of commonly used Gaussian-process peak factors is also examined. It is shown that low-frequency oscillator response signals are not well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which causes low-frequency response spectra to be overpredicted. This means RVT-optimized duration models in the literature do not have a physical interpretation at low oscillator frequencies. RVT analysis only yields approximate results, with standard deviations of 0.25 natural log units. However, it is nevertheless a simple and convenient method for rapidly predicting peak high-frequency ground motions.},

abstract = {Summary The lateral variation of Lg wave spectral attenuation in Central America was studied through tomographic inversion at various frequencies between 0.5 and 5 Hz, separately for each frequency. The input data set consisted of 558 travel paths recorded on short-period and broad-band seismic stations in the region. The size and quality of the data set were sufficient to resolve significant lateral variation in the Lg wave quality factor QLg . The average dependence of QLg with frequency was found to be QLg(f) = 182f0.84 , corresponding to high attenuation. Low QLg values in the Nicaraguan Depression presented the most significant variation from the average. The strong attenuation of Lg waves in the Nicaraguan depression was also observed in the visual analysis of the seismograms. This observation is possibly explained by the near-surface low-velocity layers in the depression. Low QLg values were also found along the chain of volcanos due to increased scattering and partial melting beneath the volcanic belt. This study is the first attempt to determine QLg for Central America and to provide knowledge on attenuation of Lg waves needed for the prediction of ground motion during future earthquakes.},

abstract = {Kriging is a popular analysis approach for computer experiments for the purpose of creating a cheap-to-compute "meta-model" as a surrogate to a computationally expensive engineering simulation model. The maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the parameters in the kriging model. However, the likelihood function near the optimum may be flat in some situations, which leads to maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters in the covariance matrix that have very large variance. To overcome this difficulty, a penalized likelihood approach is proposed for the kriging model. Both theoretical analysis and empirical experience using real world data suggest that the proposed method is particularly important in the context of a computationally intensive simulation model where the number of simulation runs must be kept small because collection of a large sample set is prohibitive. The proposed approach is applied to the reduction of piston slap, an unwanted engine noise due to piston secondary motion. Issues related to practical implementation of the proposed approach are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality.},

abstract = {A damping modification factor (DMF) model without source and path parameters is presented in this article for subduction slab earthquakes in Japan, using a similar dataset in the Zhao, Jiang, et al. (2016) study. Site classes based on site periods were used as the site-effect proxy. DMF models were derived from spectra of 13 damping ratios and 34 spectral periods, and the DMF can be calculated for any damping ratio between 1{\%} and 30{\%} and at any spectral period between 0.03 and 5.0 s. A simple fourth-order polynomial for the logarithm of the spectral periods and a simple quadratic function of the logarithm of damping ratios were used to model the effects of spectral periods and damping ratios, respectively. The model satisfies boundary conditions that require the DMF values equal to 1.0 at very short spectral periods; at long spectral periods, the DMFs for different damping ratios appear to converge to 1.0 to satisfy the constant displacement spectrum at long periods. Model standard deviations are smaller than those for the ground-motion prediction equations. All standard deviations vary linearly with the increasing logarithm of damping ratios. The DMFs presented in this study combined with the spectrum from the Zhao, Jiang, et al. (2016) study produce smoothed displacement spectrum that may be used for engineering designs. In a spectral period range of 0.2–3.0 s, the DMF values from this study are close to those by Daneshvar et al. (2016), but, at short periods, the difference is significant. The residual distribution suggests that DMFs also depend on earthquake source and path parameters. The model presented in this article does not include the effect of source and path variables so that this model can be used to scale a 5{\%} damped spectrum without a known magnitude and a source distance.},

abstract = {Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are used to express seismic intensity measures as a function of source-, path-, and site-related parameters. Functional models are still widely used for their computation. Fully data-driven approaches have been recently proposed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the estimation errors of the predictor parameters (e.g., the magnitude and VS30) are generally not accounted for in the development of GMPEs. In the present study, the uncertainty in the magnitude- and site-related parameters is considered in the establishment of GMPEs by ANNs. For this, an algorithm is proposed based on the generalized least-squares principle applied to ANNs training. A simulated database is used to validate the approach and to demonstrate the effect of the input parameter uncertainties on the GMPEs. Finally, the proposed model is applied to the Reference database for seismic ground motion in Europe (RESORCE) database. Results show that the consideration of uncertainty in the magnitude- and site-related parameters can reduce the total GMPE uncertainties by 4{\%}–16{\%}, whereas the median predictions remain similar.},

abstract = {Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are typically estimated via regression of a ground-motion parameter of interest (such as peak ground accel-eration or spectral acceleration) against source-, path-, and site-related parameters, such as magnitude, distance, or time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (V S30), with physical considerations taken into account. Typically, the predictor variables are treated as error free in the regression; however, there can be significant errors in these parameters because magnitudes are often converted from one scale to another (such as local magnitude to moment magnitude) and V S30 is often inferred from local geology instead of measured. We propose a Bayesian measurement error model that allows one to take into account measurement uncertainty in predictor var-iables, such as magnitude, in the development of a GMPE. The model treats the value of the predictor variable as a parameter to be estimated, constrained by its observed value and (known) variance of the measurement error. The model is cast in a Bayesian fashion to allow the inclusion of relevant prior information, as well as a probabilistic interpretation of the results. We apply the model to California data of the Next Generation Attenuation-West2 data set and take into account measurement error in magnitudes and V S30 . We find that the median predictions are similar when compared with a standard regression but that the values of the between-event standard deviation $\tau$ and the within-event/within-station standard deviation ϕ S2S are reduced by about 1{\%}–13{\%}, depending on the spectral period.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Western Canada sedimentary basin (WCSB) has experienced an increase in seismicity during the last decade due primarily to hydraulic fracturing. Understanding the ground motions of these induced earthquakes is critical to characterize the increase in hazard. Stress drop is considered an important parameter in this context because it is a measure of the high‐frequency content of the shaking. We use the empirical Green's function (EGF) method to determine S‐wave corner frequencies and stress drops of 87 earthquakes of moment magnitude (M) 2.3–4.4 in the WCSB. The EGF method is an effective technique to isolate earthquake source effects by dividing out the path and site components in the frequency domain, using a smaller collocated earthquake as an EGF. The corner frequency of the target event is determined for an assumed spectral ratio shape, from which the stress drop is computed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Hazard in this context means the probability of exceeding a measure of ground shaking intensity, such as peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration. The main components of the proposed framework include structural reliability methods to estimate exceedance probabilities and their sensitivities, and multiple probabilistic models for earthquake occurrence, magnitude, location, and ground motion. This paper presents two analysis approaches. The first approach utilizes the first- and second-order reliability methods and importance sampling. This approach efficiently yields the hazard exceedance probabilities at a single site. The second approach employs the Monte Carlo sampling reliability method and yields the hazard exceedance probabilities at a multitude of sites in a single analysis, which is suited for large-scale seismic zonation. This paper also presents the probabilistic models that are suited for such analyses with an emphasis on characterization of epistemic uncertainties. Finally, novel sensitivity measures are proposed for hazard sensitivity analysis. These measures provide a framework to identify the most important uncertainties and guide the research to reduce these uncertainties over time. The proposed approach is validated and showcased by an illustrative example. The companion paper presents a comprehensive application to hazard analysis of Iran.},

abstract = {Explained variance (R2) is a familiar summary of the fit of a linear regression and has been generalized in various ways to multilevel (hierarchical) models. The multilevel models that we consider in this article are characterized by hierarchical data structures in which individuals are grouped into units (which themselves might be further grouped into larger units), and variables are measured on individuals and each grouping unit. The models are based on regression relationships at different levels, with the first level corresponding to the individual data and subsequent levels corresponding to between-group regressions of individual predictor effects on grouping unit variables. We present an approach to defining R2 at each level of the multilevel model, rather than attempting to create a single summary measure of fit. Our method is based on comparing variances in a single fitted model rather than with a null model. In simple regression, our measure generalizes the classical adjusted R2. We also discuss ...},

@article{Petersen2011,
abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology, data, and regression equations for calculating the fault rupture hazard at sites near steeply dipping, strike-slip faults. We collected and digitized on-fault and off-fault displacement data for 9 global strikeslip earthquakes ranging from moment magnitude M 6.5 to M 7.6 and supplemented these with displacements from 13 global earthquakes compiled byWesnousky (2008), who considers events up to M 7.9. Displacements on the primary fault fall off at the rupture ends and are often measured in meters, while displacements on secondary (offfault) or distributed faults may measure a few centimeters up to more than a meter and decay with distance from the rupture. Probability of earthquake rupture is less than 15{\%} for cells 200 m×200 m and is less than 2{\%} for 25 m×25 m cells at distances greater than 200mfrom the primary-fault rupture. Therefore, the hazard for off-fault ruptures is much lower than the hazard near the fault. Our data indicate that rupture displacements up to 35cm can be triggered on adjacent faults at distances out to 10kmor more from the primary-fault rupture. An example calculation shows that, for an active fault which has repeated large earthquakes every few hundred years, fault rupture hazard analysis should be an important consideration in the design of structures or lifelines that are located near the principal fault, within about 150 m of well-mapped active faults with a simple trace and within 300 m of faults with poorly defined or complex traces.},

abstract = {Seismic hazard associated with Cascadia megathrust earthquakes is strongly dependent on the landward rupture extent and heterogeneous fault properties. We use 3D numerical simulations and a seismic velocity model for Cascadia to estimate coseismic deformation due to M 9–9.2 earthquake scenarios. Our earthquake source model is based on observations of the 2010 M 8.8 Maule and 2011 M 9.0 Tohoku earthquakes, which exhibited distinct strong motion‐generating subevents in the deep portion of the fault. We compare our estimates for land‐level change to paleoseismic estimates for coseismic coastal subsidence during the A.D. 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Results show that megathrust rupture extending to the 1 cm/yr locking contour provides a good match to geologic data. In addition, along‐strike variations in coastal subsidence can be matched by including low slip, strong motion‐generating subevents in the down‐dip region of the megathrust. This work demonstrates the potential to improve seismic hazard estimates for Cascadia earthquakes by comparing physics‐based earthquake simulations with geologic observations.},

abstract = {Strong-motion data recorded within 50 km of the rupture zone were used to study near-source attenuation characteristics of horizontal peak ground acceleration for worldwide earthquakes of magnitudes 5.0 to 7.7. The data base consisted of 229 horizontal components of peak acceleration recorded from 27 earthquakes, including the 15 October 1979, Imperial Valley earthquake. These data were found to be adequately represented by the functional relationship [IMG] fd1.gif“ ALT=”Formula“ BORDER=”0“{\textgreater} where PGA represents the mean of the peak values scaled from the two horizontal components of each recording, M is Richter magnitude, and R is distance from the fault rupture zone. Peak acceleration was found to be lognormally distributed with a standard error representing a 45 per cent increase in the median estimate. The regression analysis statistically confirmed the results of earthquake simulation studies that have predicted peak acceleration to become independent of magnitude and distance in the near field. An extensive sensitivity study showed that predictions based on our attenuation relationships are stable with respect to reasonable model and parameter variations. An analysis of residuals was used to investigate the behavior of peak acceleration with respect to various earthquake, site, and recording parameters, the more significant findings being: (1) a similarity in the level of acceleration recorded on soil or rock; (2) larger than average accelerations recorded at sites located on shallow soils or in areas of steep topography; (3) larger than average accelerations associated with earthquakes having reverse fault mechanisms; and (4) lower than average accelerations recorded in large embedded structures.},

Numerical results from estimating means and variances of a set of beta distributions indicate surprisingly large differences in accuracy among approximations in current use, with some of the most popular ones such as the PERT and triangular-density-function approximations faring poorly. A simple new three-point approximation, which is a straightforward extension of earlier work by Pearson and Tukey, outperforms the others significantly in these tests, and also performs well in related multivariate tests involving the Dirichlet family of distributions. IT offers an attractive alternative to currently used approximations in a variety of applications.},

abstract = {We present a summary of the Bayless and Abrahamson (2018b) empirical ground-motion model (GMM) for shallow crustal earthquakes in California based on the Next Generation Attenuation-West2 database (Ancheta et al., 2014). This model is denoted as BA18. Rather than the traditional response spectrum GMM, BA18 is developed for the smoothed effective amplitude spectrum (EAS), as defined by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (Goulet et al., 2018). The EAS is the orientation-independent horizontal-component Fourier amplitude spectrum of ground acceleration. The model is developed using a database dominated by California earthquakes but takes advantage of crustal earthquake data worldwide to constrain the magnitude scaling and geometric spreading. The near-fault saturation is guided by finite-fault numerical simulations, and nonlinear site amplification is incorporated using a modified version of Hashash et al. (2018). The model is applicable for rupture distances of 0-300 km, M 3.0-8.0, and over the frequency range 0.1-100 Hz. The model is considered applicable for VS30 in the range 180-1500 m=s, although it is not well constrained for VS30 values {\textgreater}1000 m=s. Models for the median and the aleatory variability of the EAS are developed. Regional models for Japan and Taiwan will be developed in a future update of the model. A MATLAB program that implements the EAS GMM is provided in the E supplemental content to this article.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques have revolutionized the field of Bayesian statistics. Their enormous power and their gener- alizability have rendered them the method of choice for statistical inference in many scientific disciplines. Their power is so great that they can even accommodate situations in which the structure of the statistical model itself is uncertain. However, the analysis of such “trans-dimensional” models is not easy, with several significant tech- nical and practical difficulties to overcome. In this paper we present a class of graphical models that allow relatively straightforward anal- ysis of a subset of these trans-dimensional problems.We also present a ‘guided tour' of the reversible jump methodology underlying our approach and discuss how each of the various difficulties has been circumvented. Our approach has been implemented using the Win- BUGS framework as a Gibbs-Metropolis sampling ‘engine'. The main advantage of this is that it affords the analyst much modelling flexi- bility: trans-dimensional sub-graphs may be used as generic compo- nents within an arbitrarily wide range of Bayesian graphical models. We present three example analyses to illustrate our approach.},

@article{Bommer2006a,
abstract = {Peak ground velocity (PGV) has received much less attention in the technical literature than more widely-used parameters such as peak ground acceleration (PGA) and response spectral ordinates. However, there are many examples of the use of PGV in engineering seismology and earthquake engineering, including as a parameter from which to estimate macroseismic intensity and structural damage. PGV is also employed in some methods for the assessment of liquefaction potential and, because of its relationship to ground strains, in the seismic design and assessment of buried pipelines. One of the most important uses of PGV has been in the construction of elastic response spectra. There are relatively few predictive equations for PGV, compared to those for PGA and spectral ordinates, but 25 such equations are reviewed and summarised. The issue of scaling PGV from response spectral ordinates is explored and it is shown that the common practice of scaling PGV from spectral accelerations at 1.0 second should not be continued because the ratio of the two quantities is highly variable. A more stable relationship exists between PGV and the spectral acceleration at 0.5 second response period; however, it is clearly preferable to estimate peak velocities directly and PGV equations should be derived together with equations for spectral ordinates in the same way as PGA.},

abstract = {Gaussian Process (GP) regression models typically assume that residuals are Gaussian and have the same variance for all observations. However, applications with input-dependent noise (heteroscedastic residuals) frequently arise in practice, as do applications in which the residuals do not have a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose a GP Regression model with a latent variable that serves as an additional unobserved covariate for the regression. This model (which we call GPLC) allows for heteroscedasticity since it allows the function to have a changing partial derivative with respect to this unobserved covariate. With a suitable covariance function, our GPLC model can handle (a) Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (b) non-Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (c) Gaussian residuals with constant variance. We compare our model, using synthetic datasets, with a model proposed by Goldberg, Williams and Bishop (1998), which we refer to as GPLV, which only deals with case (a), as well as a standard GP model which can handle only case (c). Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are developed for both modelsl. Experiments show that when the data is heteroscedastic, both GPLC and GPLV give better results (smaller mean squared error and negative log-probability density) than standard GP regression. In addition, when the residual are Gaussian, our GPLC model is generally nearly as good as GPLV, while when the residuals are non-Gaussian, our GPLC model is better than GPLV.},

abstract = {We estimate the variance in ground motions related to repeated large earthquakes occurring on the same fault segment with similar magnitudes. We find eight earthquake pairs for which suitable strong-motion records exist. Two are crustal strike-slip earthquakes from California and six are subduction zone earthquakes from Japan.We consider only large earthquakes and deal with frequencies greater than the earthquake corner frequency, so the variability that is considered here is related to smaller scale differences in the rupture process, particularly on the part of the fault nearest the station.We find that the variance of the 5{\%} damped spectral accelerations of these pairs, termed $\tau$2 F, averages to about 45{\%} and 80{\%} of $\tau$2 for the crustal and subduction zone earthquakes, respectively, in which $\tau$2 is the contribution of source variability to the total variability of ground motion estimated by some recent ground- motion prediction equations.We suggest that $\tau$2 F is lower than $\tau$2, for the frequencies at which $\tau$2 F is estimated, because it depends primarily on only local physical properties of a fault that are the same in repeated earthquakes.We therefore suggest that at sites where the hazard is controlled by a single rerupturing source, one could potentially use a between-event variance that is smaller than $\tau$2 in seismic-hazard calculations. Thus, these results may help to resolve the inconsistencies that are now present between the national hazard maps and some precariously balanced rocks in southern California. Introduction},

abstract = {The Earthquake Model of Middle East (EMME) Project aimed to develop regional scale seismic hazard and risk models uniformly throughout a region extending from the Eastern Mediterranean in the west to the Himalayas in the east and from the Gulf of Oman in the south to the Greater Caucasus in the North; a region which has been continuously devastated by large earthquakes throughout the history. The 2014 Seismic Hazard Model of Middle East (EMME-SHM14) was developed with the contribution of several institutions from ten countries. The present paper summarizes the efforts towards building a homogeneous seismic hazard model of the region and highlights some of the main results of this model. An important aim of the project was to transparently communicate the data and methods used and to obtain reproducible results. By doing so, the use of the model and results will be accessible by a wide community, further support the mitigation of seismic risks in the region and facilitate future improvements to the seismic hazard model. To this end all data, results and methods used are made available through the web-portal of the European Facilities for Earthquake Hazard and Risk (www.efehr.org).},

abstract = {Scientific research of all kinds should be guided by statistical thinking: in the design and conduct of the study, in the disciplined exploration and enlightened display of the data, and to avoid statistical pitfalls in the interpretation of the results. However, formal, probability-based statistical inference should play no role in most scientific research, which is inherently exploratory, requiring flexible methods of analysis that inherently risk overfitting. The nature of exploratory work is that data are used to help guide model choice, and under these circumstances, uncertainty cannot be precisely quantified, because of the inevitable model selection bias that results. To be valid, statistical inference should be restricted to situations where the study design and analysis plan are specified prior to data collection. Exploratory data analysis provides the flexibility needed for most other situations, including statistical methods that are regularized, robust, or nonparametric. Of course, no ...},

abstract = {The deaggregation of seismic hazard is an effective way to identify  scenario events that contribute to a selected seismic-hazard level. Depending on the use of the deaggregation results, the contribution may be defined as equal to or exceeding the selected hazard level. The deaggregation of seismic hazard should consider all uncertainty, aleatory uncertainty, and epistemic uncertainty. The identified scenario events can be used to check the responses of structures such as buildings. However, structures are constructed to provide service rather than just sustain environmental disturbances, and the seismic-risk assessment is at least as important and valuable as the seismic-hazard assessment for emergency preparedness planning  and for the financial industry. Therefore, the notion of the deaggregation of seismic hazard is extended to that of seismic risk in the present study. Other issues investigated in this study are the impact of approximate treatment of epistemic uncertainty  and the Cascadia subduction events on the deaggregation, and the differences in the identified scenario events from the deaggregation of seismic hazard and seismic risk.  Numerical results suggest that the contribution of the uncertainty in attenuation relations to the deaggregation results can be very significant, and that the identified scenario events by deaggregating seismic hazard and seismic risk are somewhat different. Also, the elapsed time since the last major event for source zones whose earthquake occurrence is modeled as a renewal process can affect the deaggregation results significantly.},

abstract = {Damping modification factors (DMFs) are important for estimating the response spectrum for the design of structures with different damping ratios. This study investigated the effects of earthquake source parameters (magnitude, source depth, and source categories), source distance (the closest distance from a site to a fault plane for large earthquakes and hypocentral distance for the other events), and site conditions on DMFs for the displacement and acceleration response spectra of the horizontal components of the records from Japan. This study used a total of 14,713 strong‐motion records from the KiK‐net and K‐NET to compare the DMFs from three earthquake category groups, namely shallow crustal and upper mantle, subduction interface, and subduction slab earthquakes. Statistical tests were carried out to determine whether the DMFs from these three types of earthquakes differ significantly from each other. The test results show that, between each pair of the three types of earthquakes, the DMFs for both displacement and acceleration response spectra differ significantly in terms of statistical tests and practically for engineering applications at many spectral periods, with the largest difference over 40{\%}. The effects of earthquake category and site conditions for acceleration spectrum are similar to those of the displacement spectrum at short periods up to about 0.3 s but are much larger than those of the displacement spectrum at long spectral periods. The effects of magnitude and earthquake depth are also significant. Therefore, separate DMF models for the response spectrum of the horizontal component should be derived for each type of earthquake and should account for the effects of earthquake source and path parameters and site conditions.},

In order to obtain a set of site coefficients and spectral shapes, we have first deduced an attenuation law for both horizontal and vertical motion. Site conditions are represented by the shear velocity averaged over the upper 30 m (V[sub s][sup 30]). Our site classification (4 categories similar to those proposed in the new EC8 and the UBC97) is based on borehole investigations at every station. This classification has permitted to distinguish clearly four response spectra which demonstrates the efficiency of V[sub s][sup 30] as characterising site conditions. Our law is then used to test site coefficients and spectral shapes of building codes EC8 and UBC97. Concerning spectral shapes and site coefficients, our results are found to be in good agreement with EC8 and UBC97 only if category B (400 {\textless} V[sub s][sup},

For this purpose, as a more reliable predictor of site amplification, HVSR have been calculated from pseudo-spectral acceleration of Iranian ground motions database consisted of 560 records from 30 events with moment magnitude ranging from 3.7 to 7.7 at epicentral distance of 1.7–297 km. Proposed HVSR model for Iran has been compared with the other regional models developed for California, Japan, Taiwan, Italy and China.

abstract = {We summarize the main elements of a ground-motion model, as built in three-year effort within the Earthquake Model of the Middle East (EMME) project. Together with the earthquake source, the ground-motion models are used for a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) of a region covering eleven countries: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey. Given the wide variety of ground-motion predictive models, selecting the appropriate ones for modeling the intrinsic epistemic uncertainty can be challenging. In this respect, we provide a strategy for ground-motion model selection based on data-driven testing and sensitivity analysis. Our testing procedure highlights the models of good performance in terms of both data-driven and non-data-driven testing criteria. The former aims at measuring the match between the ground-motion data and the prediction of each model, whereas the latter aims at identification of discrepancies between the models. The selected set of ground models were directly used in the sensitivity analyses that eventually led to decisions on the final logic tree structure. The strategy described in great details hereafter was successfully applied to shallow active crustal regions, and the final logic tree consists of four models (Akkar and {\c{C}}ağnan in Bull Seismol Soc Am 100:2978–2995, 2010; Akkar et al. in Bull Earthquake Eng 12(1):359–387, 2014; Chiou and Youngs in Earthq Spectra 24:173–215, 2008; Zhao et al. in Bull Seismol Soc Am 96:898–913, 2006). For other tectonic provinces in the considered region (i.e., subduction), we adopted the predictive models selected within the 2013 Euro-Mediterranean Seismic Hazard Model (Woessner et al. in Bull Earthq Eng 13(12):3553–3596, 2015). Finally, we believe that the framework of selecting and building a regional ground-motion model represents a step forward in ground-motion modeling, particularly for large-scale PSHA models.},

@article{Zoller2018,
abstract = {Abstract Paleoearthquakes and historic earthquakes are the most important source of information for the estimation of long-term earthquake recurrence intervals in fault zones, because corresponding sequences cover more than one seismic cycle. However, these events are often rare, dating uncertainties are enormous, and missing or misinterpreted events lead to additional problems. In the present study, I assume that the time to the next major earthquake depends on the rate of small and intermediate events between the large ones in terms of a ?clock change? model. Mathematically, this leads to a Brownian passage time distribution for recurrence intervals. I take advantage of an earlier finding that under certain assumptions the aperiodicity of this distribution can be related to the Gutenberg-Richter b value, which can be estimated easily from instrumental seismicity in the region under consideration. In this way, both parameters of the Brownian passage time distribution can be attributed with accessible seismological quantities. This allows to reduce the uncertainties in the estimation of the mean recurrence interval, especially for short paleoearthquake sequences and high dating errors. Using a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation results in a statistical model for earthquake recurrence intervals that assimilates in a simple way paleoearthquake sequences and instrumental data. I present illustrative case studies from Southern California and compare the method with the commonly used approach of exponentially distributed recurrence times based on a stationary Poisson process.},

The radial basis functions at each level of resolution are constructed using a Wendland compactly supported correlation function with the nodes arranged on a rectangular grid. The grid at each finer level increases by a factor of two and the basis functions are scaled to have a constant overlap. The coefficients associated with the basis functions at each level of resolution are distributed according to a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and take advantage of the fact that the basis is organized as a lattice. Several numerical examples and analytical results establish that this scheme gives a good approximation to standard covariance functions such as the Mat{\'{e}}rn and also has flexibility to fit more complicated shapes. The other important feature of this model is that it can be applied to statistical inference for large spatial datasets because key matrices in the computations are sparse. The computational efficiency applies to both the evaluation of the likelihood and spatial predictions.},

abstract = {Learning in Gaussian Process models occurs through the adaptation of hyperparameters of the mean and the covariance function. The classical approach entails maximizing the marginal likelihood yielding fixed point estimates (an approach called $\backslash$textit{\{}Type II maximum likelihood{\}} or ML-II). An alternative learning procedure is to infer the posterior over hyperparameters in a hierarchical specification of GPs we call $\backslash$textit{\{}Fully Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression{\}} (GPR). This work considers two approximation schemes for the intractable hyperparameter posterior: 1) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) yielding a sampling-based approximation and 2) Variational Inference (VI) where the posterior over hyperparameters is approximated by a factorized Gaussian (mean-field) or a full-rank Gaussian accounting for correlations between hyperparameters. We analyze the predictive performance for fully Bayesian GPR on a range of benchmark data sets.},

This paper reports on a project begun in 2009 to reformulate this problem in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian seismic monitoring system, NET‐VISA, has been built comprising a spatial event prior and generative models of event transmission and detection, as well as an inference algorithm. The probabilistic model allows for seamless integration of various disparate sources of information. Applied in the context of the International Monitoring System (IMS), a global sensor network developed for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), NET‐VISA achieves a reduction of around 60{\%} in the number of missed events compared with the currently deployed system. It also finds events that are missed by the human analysts who postprocess the IMS output.},

abstract = {We present a methodology for the selection of accelerometric time histories as input for dynamic response analyses over vast areas. The method is primarily intended for seismic microzonation studies and regional probabilistic seismic hazard assessments that account for site effects. It is also suitable for structural response analyses if one would like to use a fixed set of ground motion records for analyzing multiple structures with different (or unknown) periods. The proposed procedure takes advantage of unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify zones (i.e., groups of sites) with homogeneous seismic hazard, for which the same set of earthquake recordings can be reasonably used in the numerical simulations. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) data-driven cluster analysis to identify groups of sites with comparable seismic hazard levels for a specified mean return period (MRP); (2) for each zone, definition of a single, reference uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) corresponding to the MRP of interest; (3) selection of a set of accelerometric recordings that are consistent with the magnitude-distance scenarios contributing to the hazard of each zone, and meet the spectrum-compatibility requirement with respect to the reference UHS. An application of the procedure in the Po Plain (Northern Italy) is described in detail.},

The intrinsic variability of the 62 interval slip rates on these normal faults is assessed by normalizing the long-term slip rate of each fault to 0.1 mm/yr. The cumulative density function of the grouped data predicts that, given a mean net slip rate of 0.12 mm/yr, extreme slip rates with 10{\%} and 5{\%} probability of exceedance are 0.51 and 0.92 mm/yr, respectively. These slip rates are considerably higher than those chosen by an expert panel for the Pajarito Fault, New Mexico, which has a long-term mean slip rate of ca. 0.12 mm/yr.},

abstract = {Many models for the study of point-referenced data explicitly introduce spatial random effects to capture residual spatial association. These spatial effects are customarily modelled as a zero-mean stationary Gaussian process. The spatial Dirichlet process introduced by Gelfand et al. (2005) produces a random spatial process which is neither Gaussian nor stationary. Rather, it varies about a process that is assumed to be stationary and Gaussian. The spatial Dirichlet process arises as a probability-weighted collection of random surfaces. This can be limiting for modelling and inferential purposes since it insists that a process realization must be one of these surfaces. We introduce a random distribution for the spatial effects that allows different surface selection at different sites. Moreover, we can specify the model so that the marginal distribution of the effect at each site still comes from a Dirichlet process. The development is offered constructively, providing a multivariate extension of the stick-breaking representation of the weights. We then introduce mixing using this generalized spatial Dirichlet process. We illustrate with a simulated dataset of independent replications and note that we can embed the generalized process within a dynamic model specification to eliminate the independence assumption. {\textcopyright} 2007 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract = {Histories of earthquakes and tsunamis, inferred from geological evidence, aid in anticipating future catastrophes. This natural warning system now influences building codes and tsunami planning in the United States, Canada, and Japan, particularly where geology demonstrates the past occurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis larger than those known from written and instrumental records. Under favorable circumstances, paleoseismology can thus provide long-term advisories of unusually large tsunamis. The extraordinary Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 resulted from a fault rupture more than 1000 km in length that included and dwarfed fault patches that had broken historically during lesser shocks. Such variation in rupture mode, known from written history at a few subduction zones, is also characteristic of earthquake histories inferred from geology on the Pacific Rim.

abstract = {Macroseismic intensity data are an important source to learn from historical earthquakes. Nevertheless, this data needs to be converted into more suitable intensity measures to be used in risk analyses, as well as in design practice. To this purpose, in this paper, correlations between macroseismic scales and ground motion parameters have been derived. Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) and Housner Intensity (IH) as instrumental measures, and European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98) and Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) as macroseismic measures, have been considered. 179 ground-motion records belonging to 32 earthquake events occurred in Italy in the last 40 years have been selected, provided that for each record, macroseismic intensity in terms of either EMS-98 or MCS or both were also available. Statistical analyses have been carried out to derive both direct (i.e. macroseismic vs instrumental intensity) and inverse (instrumental vs macroseismic intensity) relationships. Results obtained from the proposed relationships have been analyzed and compared with some of the most prominent results available in the technical literature.},

abstract = {The 1700 Cascadia earthquake attained moment magnitude 9 according to new estimates based on effects of its tsunami in Japan, computed coseismic seafloor deformation for hypothetical ruptures in Cascadia, and tsunami modeling in the Pacific Ocean. Reports of damage and flooding show that the 1700 Casscadia tsunami reached 1-5 m heights at seven shoreline sites in Japan. Three sets of estimated heights express uncertainty about location and depth of reported flooding, landward decline in tsunami heights from shorelines, and post-1700 land-level changes. We compare each set with tsunami heights computed from six Cascadia sources. Each source is vertical seafloor displacement calculated with a three-dimensional elastic dislocation model, for three sources the rupture extends the 1100 km length of the subduction zone and differs in width and shallow dip; for the other sources, ruptures of ordinary width extend 360-670 km. To compute tsunami waveforms, we use a linear long-wave approximation with a finite difference method, and we employ modern bathymetry with nearshore grid spacing as small as 0.4 km. The various combinations of Japanese tsunami heights and Cascadia sources give seismic moment of 1-9 × 10 22 N m, equivalent to moment magnitude 8.7-9.2. This range excludes several unquantified uncertainties. The most likely earthquake, of moment magnitude 9.0, has 19 m of coseismic slip on an offshore, full-slip zone 1100 km long with linearly decreasing slip on a downdip partial-slip zone. The shorter rupture models require up to 40 m offshore slip and predict land-level changes inconsistent with coastal paleoseismological evidence. Copyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The main goal of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is to calculate the probability of exceedance for a range of shaking levels at a particular site. This requires the use of calculating the conditional probability of a ground motion intensity parameter of engineering interest given some earthquake and site related parameters such as magnitude, distance or Vs30. For that purpose, usually empirical regression models are employed, which are referred to as Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs). Some problems in this context relate to the functional form of the GMPE and the choice of predictor variables that are assumed to affect the ground motion distribution. Here we address these issues by adhering to the multivariate statistical framework Bayesian Networks (BNs). We investigate the use of Bayesian Networks in PSHA in general, and illustrate the applicability and advantages of employing BNs in the ground motion domain. Our departure point is motivated by the desire to learn from data, inother words, we take a data-driven stance and learn a Bayesian Network from a strong motion dataset consisting of several earthquake, site and ground motion parameters. By analyzing and inspecting the resulting BN this approach allows us to assess the actual probabilistic (in)dependencies that hold between these parameters as supported by the data. We also derive Bayesian networks using "classical" GMPEs. The Bayesian networks for the ground motion domain are extended based on a priori domain knowledge: we incorporate other variables, parameters and relate them in a way that we deem appropriate and relevant for PSHA. Thus, we arrive at a full-fledged multivariate statistical model of PSHA in terms of a Bayesian network. Since Bayesian networks provide a principled framework for reasoning (by way of statistical inference) under uncertainty, this offers the possibility to incorporate various sources of uncertainty and variability that prevail in PSHA into a single network. From this network, we can now easily compute e.g. the conditional distribution of the ground motion parameter of interest given different sets of evidence for the earthquake and site parameters. Hence, we can use the PSHA-Bayesian network to easily investigate the PSHA results with regard to uncertainties of different variables that are important for PSHA, and we can examine the influence of several earthquake and site related parameters on the hazard curve. The use of Bayesian networks for PSHA also offers new perspectives for evaluating/ disaggregating the results of a hazard study, since it is possible to compute any marginal or conditional distribution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {Recently, a new curve detection approach called the randomized Hough transform (RHT) was heuristically proposed by the authors, inspired by the efforts of using neural computation learning techniques for curve detection. The preliminary experimental results and some qualitative analysis showed that in comparison with the Hough transform (HT) and its variants, the RHT has advantages of fast speed, small storage, infinite range of the parameter space, and high parameter resolution, and it can overcome several difficulties encountered with the HT methods. In this paper, the basic ideas of RHT are further developed into a more systematic and theoretically supported new method for curve detection. The fundamental framework and the main components of this method are elaborated. The advantages of RHT are further confirmed. The basic mechanisms behind these advantages are exposed by both theoretical analysis and detailed experimental demonstrations. The main differences between RHT and some related techniques are elucidated. This paper also proposes several improved algorithms for implementing RHT for curve detection problems in noisy images. They are tested by experiments on images with various kinds of strong noise. The results show that the advantages of RHT are quite robust. Moreover, the implementations of these algorithms are modeled by a generalized Bernoulli process, allowing probability analysis on these algorithms to estimate their computational complexities and to decide some important parameters for their implementations. It is shown quantitatively that the complexities are considerably smaller than those of the HT. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We acquired a unique ambient vibration dataset from Castleton Tower, a 120 m high bedrock monolith located near Moab, Utah, to resolve dynamic and material properties of the landform. We identified the first two resonant modes at 0.8 and 1.0 Hz, which consist of mutually perpendicular, linearly polarized horizontal ground motion at the top of the tower. Damping ratios for these modes were low at ∼1{\%}. We successfully reproduced field data in 3D numerical eigenfrequency simulation implementing a Young's modulus of 7 GPa, a value ∼30{\%} lower than measured on core samples. Our analysis confirms that modal deformation at the first resonant frequencies closely resembles that of a cantilever beam. The outcome is that with basic estimates of geometry and material properties, the resonant frequencies of other freestanding rock monoliths can be estimated a priori. Such estimates are crucial to evaluate the response of rock towers to external vibration inputs.},

Earthquake disasters occur mainly due to the collapse of buildings and structures triggered by ground motions. It is, therefore, important to predict ground-shaking levels in order to determine appropriate building code provisions for earthquake-resistant design of structures. This involves extensive analyses and development of appropriate seismological models; namely, seismogenic sources, seismic site conditions, and ground motion predictions. The hazard products, viz. data and maps, constitute important tools for framing public policies toward land-use planning, building regulations, insurance, and emergency preparedness. View this table:In this windowIn a new windowTable 1 Major Earthquake Casualties during 1900–2008 in India and Adjoining Regions In India, several events during the last 100 years, as listed in Table 1, indicate that even moderate earthquakes (MW {\&}lt; 7.0) can cause significant devastation. On one hand, ongoing urbanization and unprecedented population growth have considerably aggravated the prevailing seismic risk. On the other hand, the available seismic hazard maps covering the entire country are about a decade old. Consequently an updated seismic hazard model for the country is imperative and necessitated by new data, recent findings, and methodological improvements. In the present study, we make a case for new probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) of India. The fundamental studies have been carried out to deliver the hazard components, including seismogenic source zonation and seismicity modeling in the Indian subcontinent (Thingbaijam and Nath 2011), assessment of site conditions across the country (Nath, Thingbaijam, Adhikari et al. 2011), and a suitability test for the ground-motion prediction equations in the regional context (Nath and Thingbaijam 2011).

abstract = {The Gaussian process is an indispensable tool for spatial data analysts. The onset of the "big data" era, however, has lead to the traditional Gaussian process being computationally infeasible for modern spatial data. As such, various alternatives to the full Gaussian process that are more amenable to handling big spatial data have been proposed. These modern methods often exploit low rank structures and/or multi-core and multi-threaded computing environments to facilitate computation. This study provides, first, an introductory overview of several methods for analyzing large spatial data. Second, this study describes the results of a predictive competition among the described methods as implemented by different groups with strong expertise in the methodology. Specifically, each research group was provided with two training datasets (one simulated and one observed) along with a set of prediction locations. Each group then wrote their own implementation of their method to produce predictions at the given location and each which was subsequently run on a common computing environment. The methods were then compared in terms of various predictive diagnostics. Supplementary materials regarding implementation details of the methods and code are available for this article online.},

abstract = {Limited data on strong earthquakes and their effect on structures pose challenges of making reliable risk assessments of tall buildings. For instance, although the collapse safety of tall buildings is likely controlled by large‐magnitude earthquakes with long durations and high low‐frequency content, there are few available recorded ground motions to evaluate these issues. The influence of geologic basins on amplifying ground‐motion effects raises additional questions. Absent recorded motions from past large magnitude earthquakes, physics‐based ground‐motion simulations provide a viable alternative. This article examines collapse risk and drift demands of a 20‐story archetype tall building using ground motions at four sites in the Los Angeles (LA) basin. Seismic demands of the building are calculated form nonlinear structural analyses using large datasets (∼500,000 ground motions per site) of unscaled, site‐specific simulated seismograms. Seismic hazard and building performance from direct analysis of Southern California Earthquake Center CyberShake motions are contrasted with values obtained based on conventional approaches that rely on recorded motions coupled with probabilistic seismic hazard assessments. At the LA downtown site, the two approaches yield similar estimates of mean annual frequency of collapse ($\lambda$c), whereas nonlinear drift demands estimated with direct analysis are slightly larger primarily because of differences in hazard curves. Conversely, at the deep basin site, the CyberShake‐based analysis yields around seven times larger $\lambda$c than the conventional approach, and both hazard and spectral shapes of the motions drive the differences. Deaggregation of collapse risk is used to identify the relative contributions of causal earthquakes, linking building responses with specific seismograms and contrasting collapse risk with hazard. A strong discriminative power of average spectral acceleration and significant duration for predicting collapse is observed.},

abstract = {We use the new global database of source time functions (STFs) and focal mechanisms proposed by Vall{\'{e}}e (2013) using the automatic SCARDEC method (Vall{\'{e}}e et al., 2011) to constrain earthquake rupture duration and variability. This database has the advantage of being very consistent since all the events with moment magnitudes Mw {\textgreater}5:8 that have occurred during the last 20 years were reanalyzed with the same method and the same station configuration. We analyze 1754 shallow earthquakes (depth {\textless} 35 km) and use high-quality criteria for the STFs, which result in the selection of 660 events. Among these, 313 occurred on the subduction interface (SUB events) and 347 outside (NOT-SUB events). We obtain that for a given magnitude, STF duration is log normally distributed and that STFs are longer for SUB than NOT-SUB events. We then estimate the stress drop using a proxy for the rupture process duration obtained from the measurement of the maximum amplitude of the STF. The resulting stress drop is independent of magnitude and is about 2.5 times smaller for the subduction events compared with the other events. Assuming a constant rupture velocity and source model, the resulting standard deviation of the stress drop is 1.13 for the total dataset (natural log), and about 1 for separate datasets. These values are significantly lower than the ones generally obtained from corner-frequency analyses with global databases (∼1:5 for Allmann and Shearer, 2009) and are closer to the values inferred from strong-motion measurements (∼0:5 as reported by Cotton et al., 2013). This indicates that the epistemic variability is reduced by the use of STF properties, which allows us to better approach the natural variability of the source process, related to stress-drop variability and/or variation in the rupture velocity.},

@article{Gomez-Rubio2018,
abstract = {The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) has established itself as a widely used method for approximate inference on Bayesian hierarchical models which can be represented as a latent Gaussian model (LGM). INLA is based on producing an accurate approximation to the posterior marginal distributions of the parameters in the model and some other quantities of interest by using repeated approximations to intermediate distributions and integrals that appear in the computation of the posterior marginals. INLA focuses on models whose latent effects are a Gaussian Markov random field. For this reason, we have explored alternative ways of expanding the number of possible models that can be fitted using the INLA methodology. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines INLA and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The aim is to consider a wider range of models that can be fitted with INLA only when some of the parameters of the model have been fixed. We show how new values of these parameters can be drawn from their posterior by using conditional models fitted with INLA and standard MCMC algorithms, such as Metropolis–Hastings. Hence, this will extend the use of INLA to fit models that can be expressed as a conditional LGM. Also, this new approach can be used to build simpler MCMC samplers for complex models as it allows sampling only on a limited number of parameters in the model. We will demonstrate how our approach can extend the class of models that could benefit from INLA, and how the R-INLA package will ease its implementation. We will go through simple examples of this new approach before we discuss more advanced applications with datasets taken from the relevant literature. In particular, INLA within MCMC will be used to fit models with Laplace priors in a Bayesian Lasso model, imputation of missing covariates in linear models, fitting spatial econometrics models with complex nonlinear terms in the linear predictor and classification of data with mixture models. Furthermore, in some of the examples we could exploit INLA within MCMC to make joint inference on an ensemble of model parameters.},

abstract = {Clustering is widely studied in statistics and machine learning, with applications in a variety of fields. As opposed to classical algorithms which return a single clustering solution, Bayesian nonparametric models provide a posterior over the entire space of partitions, allowing one to assess statistical properties, such as uncertainty on the number of clusters. However, an important problem is how to summarize the posterior; the huge dimension of partition space and difficulties in visualizing it add to this problem. In a Bayesian analysis, the posterior of a real-valued parameter of interest is often summarized by reporting a point estimate such as the posterior mean along with 95{\%} credible intervals to characterize uncertainty. In this paper, we extend these ideas to develop appropriate point estimates and credible sets to summarize the posterior of clustering structure based on decision and information theoretic techniques.},

abstract = {Ground motion simulation validation is an important and necessary task toward establishing the efficacy of physics-based ground motion simulations for seismic hazard analysis and earthquake engineering applications. This article presents a comprehensive validation of the commonly used Graves and Pitarka hybrid broadband ground motion simulation methodology with a recently developed three-dimensional (3D) Canterbury Velocity Model. This is done through simulation of 148 small magnitude earthquake events in the Canterbury, New Zealand, region in order to supplement prior validation efforts directed at several larger magnitude events. Recent empirical ground motion models are also considered to benchmark the simulation predictive capability, which is examined by partitioning the prediction residuals into the various components of ground motion variability. Biases identified in source, path, and site components suggest that improvements to the predictive capabilities of the simulation methodology can be made by using a longer high-frequency path duration model, reducing empirical V s30 -based low-frequency site amplification, and utilizing site-specific velocity models in the high-frequency simulations.},

abstract = {Existing attenuation relations in Iran mostly deal with peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity. However, spectral attenuation is needed not only for peak ground acceleration, but also for the entire range of periods. In this study, a new spectral attenuation for acceleration is presented for Iran. To that end, a database of strong ground motion in Iran consisting of 110 earthquakes and 627 accelerograms was developed. We introduced the attenuation relationship for acceleration response spectra with 5{\%} damping. The two primary factors considered were moment magnitude and source distance. A near field term was also used in the model for better estimation of acceleration spectra in the near field. Non-linear regression analysis adopted from Fukushima and Tanaka (1990) was used to obtain coefficients.},

abstract = {We investigate an isolated cluster of temporally persistent, intraslab earthquakes (ML{\textless}3.2) at {\textgreater}60 km depth below the Georgia Strait in southern British Columbia that is unique in Cascadia and meets the criteria for identification as an earthquake nest. A total of 129 relocated hypocenters define two northwest‐dipping structures in the subducting Juan de Fuca mantle within an ∼30×10×10 km3 volume. Focal mechanisms for 15 events represent a mix of strike‐slip and reverse faulting, and a stress regime of down‐dip tension and plate‐normal compression, consistent with a previous regional study. Converted seismic phases inferred to originate at the boundaries of subducted oceanic crust are observed at several receivers and are consistent with a local slab depth of ∼45 km, shallower than some JdF plate models. The geographical isolation of the nest within the confines of an extrapolated propagator wake suggests that its location is controlled by this pre‐existing and presumably hydrated structure.},

We collected and uniformly processed 1483 three-component recordings from an array of 824 sensors spanning 10 seismographic networks. We developed site metadata using available data and multiple models for the time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (VS30) and for basin depth terms. We processed ground motions using Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) procedures and computed intensity measures including spectral acceleration at a number of oscillator periods and inelastic response spectra. We compared elastic and inelastic response spectra to seismic design spectra in building codes to evaluate the damage potential of the ground motions at spatially distributed sites. Residuals of the observed spectral accelerations relative to the NGA-West2 ground-motion models (GMMs) show good average agreement between observations and model predictions (event terms between about −0.3 and 0.5 for peak ground acceleration to 5 s). The average attenuation with distance is also well captured by the empirical NGA-West2 GMMs, although azimuthal variations in attenuation were observed that are not captured by the GMMs. An analysis considering directivity and fault-slip heterogeneity for the M 7.1 event demonstrates that the dispersion in the near-source ground-motion residuals can be reduced.},

abstract = {With continued advances in Geographic Information Systems and related computational technologies, statisticians are often required to analyze very large spatial datasets. This has generated substantial interest over the last decade, already too vast to be summarized here, in scalable methodologies for analyzing large spatial datasets. Scalable spatial process models have been found especially attractive due to their richness and flexibility and, particularly so in the Bayesian paradigm, due to their presence in hierarchical model settings. However, the vast majority of research articles present in this domain have been geared toward innovative theory or more complex model development. Very limited attention has been accorded to approaches for easily implementable scalable hierarchical models for the practicing scientist or spatial analyst. This article is submitted to the Practice section of the journal with the aim of developing massively scalable Bayesian approaches that can rapidly deliver Bayesian inference on spatial process that are practically indistinguishable from inference obtained using more expensive alternatives. A key emphasis is on implementation within very standard (modest) computing environments (e.g., a standard desktop or laptop) using easily available statistical software packages without requiring message-parsing interfaces or parallel programming paradigms. Key insights are offered regarding assumptions and approximations concerning practical efficiency.},

abstract = {The Mississippi embayment, located in the central United States, and its thick deposits of sediments (over 1 km in places) have a large effect on earthquake ground motions. Several previous studies have addressed how these thick sediments might modify probabilistic seismic-hazard maps. The high seismic hazard associated  with the New Madrid seismic zone makes it particularly important to quantify the uncertainty in modeling site amplification to better represent earthquake hazard in seismic-hazard maps. The methodology of the Memphis urban seismic-hazard- mapping project (Cramer et al., 2004) is combined with the reference profile approach of Toro and Silva (2001) to better estimate seismic hazard in the Mississippi embayment. Improvements over previous approaches include using the 2002 national seismic-hazard model, fully probabilistic hazard calculations, calibration of site amplification with improved nonlinear soil-response estimates, and estimates of uncertainty. Comparisons are made with the results of several previous studies, and estimates of uncertainty inherent in site-amplification modeling for the upper Mississippi embayment are developed. I present new seismic-hazard maps for the upper Mississippi embayment with the effects of site geology incorporating these uncertainties.},

abstract = {The correlation between spectral accelerations is key in the construction of conditional mean spectra, the computation of vector-valued seismic hazard, and the assessment of seismic risk of spatially distributed systems, among other applications. Spectral correlations are highly dependent on the earthquake database used, and thus, region-specific correlation models have been developed mainly for earthquakes in western United States, Europe, Middle East, and Japan. Correlation models based on global data sets for crustal and subduction zones have also become available, but there is no consensus about their applicability on a specific region. This study proposes a new correlation model for 5{\%} damped spectral accelerations and peak ground velocity in the Chilean subduction zone. The correlations obtained were generally higher than those observed from shallow crustal earthquakes and subduction zones such as Japan and Taiwan. The study provides two illustrative applications of the correlation model: (1) computation of conditional spectra for a firm soil site located in Santiago, Chile and (2) computation of bivariate hazard for spectral accelerations at two structural periods.},

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.2.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propa- gation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line, through R using the RStan package, or through Python using the PyStan package. All three interfaces support sampling or optimization-based inference and analysis, and RStan and PyStan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, and data I/O.},

abstract = {We present a ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE) for Turkey and Iran to investigate the possible regional effects on ground-motion amplitudes in shallow active crustal earthquakes. The proposed GMPE is developed from a subset of the recently compiled strong-motion database of the Earthquake Model of the Middle East Region project (see Data and Resources). A total of 670 Turkish and 528 Iranian accelerograms with depths down to 35 km are used to estimate peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and 5{\%} damped elastic pseudospectral acceleration ordinates of 0:01 s ≤ T ≤ 4 s. The moment magnitude range of the model is 4 ≤ Mw ≤ 8, and the maximum Joyner-Boore distance is RJB {\_} 200 km. The functional form considers three major fault mechanisms (strike slip, normal, and reverse). The nonlinear soil behavior is a function of VS30 (average shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m of soil profile). Our observations from empirical and estimated ground-motion trends advocate regional differences in the territories covered by Iran and Turkey that originate from the differences in Q factors, kappa, and near-surface velocity profiles. These factors eventually affect the magnitude- and distance-dependent scaling of spectral amplitudes in Iran and Turkey. In essence, the ground-motion amplitudes of these two neighboring countries would draw patterns different than the ground-motion estimates of GMPEs developed from the strong-motion databases of shallow active crustal earthquakes from multiple countries.},

abstract = {We present a method to estimate paleomagnitude and rupture extent from measurements of displacement at a single point on a fault. The variability of historic ruptures is summarized in a histogram of normalized slip, then scaled to give the probability of finding a given displacement within a rupture for any magnitude considered. The histogram can be inverted assuming any magnitude earthquake is as likely as another, yielding probability density functions of magnitude and rupture length for any given displacement measurement. To improve these distributions we include a term to account for the probability that the earthquake would cause ground rupture and two alternative distributions of earthquake magnitude. The Gutenberg- Richter magnitude distribution predicts shorter rupture lengths and smaller magnitudes than does a uniform distribution where any magnitude earthquake is considered equally likely. Longer ruptures and larger magnitudes than the uniform model are predicted by an alternative magnitude distribution designed to return site average displacement. This model is a generalization of the characteristic earthquake model, and reasonably describes paleoseismic findings on the southern San Andreas fault, where slip is accommodated by average displacements of a few meters and earthquake recurrence times of 100-250 years. Our results should increase the value of paleoseismic displacement measurements for hazard assessment. In particular, they quantify probability estimates of earthquake magnitude and rupture length where point observations of rupture displacement are available, and so can contribute to probabilistic seismic-hazard analyses.

abstract = {Priors are important for achieving proper posteriors with physically meaningful covariance structures for Gaussian random fields (GRFs) since the likelihood typically only provides limited information about the covariance structure under in-fill asymptotics. We extend the recent penalized complexity prior framework and develop a principled joint prior for the range and the marginal variance of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional Mat{\'{e}}rn GRFs with fixed smoothness. The prior is weakly informative and penalizes complexity by shrinking the range toward infinity and the marginal variance toward zero. We propose guidelines for selecting the hyperparameters, and a simulation study shows that the new prior provides a principled alternative to reference priors that can leverage prior knowledge to achieve shorter credible intervals while maintaining good coverage. We extend the prior to a nonstationary GRF parameterized through local ranges and marginal standard deviations, and introduce a scheme for selecting the hyperparameters based on the coverage of the parameters when fitting simulated stationary data. The approach is applied to a dataset of annual precipitation in southern Norway and the scheme for selecting the hyperparameters leads to conservative estimates of nonstationarity and improved predictive performance over the stationary model. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {Because of a combination of new observational tools and a flurry of large megathrust earthquakes, tremendous progress has been made in recent years towards understanding the process of great subduction earthquakes at Cascadia and other subduction zones around the world. This review article attempts to clarify some of widely used geodynamic concepts and identify the most important scientific questions for future research related to megathrust behaviour. It is important to specify how the megathrust seismogenic zone has been defined when comparing data and models. Observations and concepts currently used to define the seismogenic zone include: (A) the stability transition in rate-and-state dependent friction; (B) the slip zone of large interplate earthquakes; (C) the distribution of small-medium earthquakes; and (D) the geodetically-determined zone of fault locking. Land-based geodetic measurements indicate that the Cascadia megathrust is locked to some extent, but the degree of locking is not well constrained. The near absence of detectable interplate seismicity, with the exception of a segment near 44.5°N and near the Mendocino Triple Junction, is presently interpreted to indicate full locking along most of Cascadia. Resolving the locking state requires seafloor geodetic measurements. The slip behaviour of the shallowest segment of the megathrust and its tsunamigenic potential are complex and variable. Structural studies combined with modeling have the potential to improve our understanding of the signature left in the structure by the slip history. For several reasons, but mostly because of interseismic viscoelastic stress relaxation, the downdip limit of megathrust locking cannot be reliably constrained by geodetic data. Independent information is needed on the composition and thermal state of fault zone materials. The spatial relationship between the seismogenic zone and the zone of Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) remains controversial. Observations from the Nankai subduction zone and the San Andreas Fault suggest that ETS does not mark a simple spatial transition from seismic to aseismic behaviour and that multiple transitions may be present because of petrological and rheological changes with depth. Coseismic rupture in the AD 1700 Cascadia earthquake has been shown to vary along strike, and it is important to investigate whether the position of boundaries between high slip and low slip are stationary with time (and therefore probably geologically controlled) and are reflected in current interseismic locking of the megathrust.},

@article{Lanzano2020,
abstract = {In Italy, earthquakes caused by volcanoes are of primary importance in the evaluation of seismic hazard, since several volcanoes seriously endanger densely populated areas (e.g. Catania and surroundings, Campi Flegrei, Vesuvius). On the other hand, there are very few models for the prediction of ground motion induced by volcanic events, mostly because observations are scarce and volcanic earthquakes less frequent than crustal events. Following the recent earthquakes in the Etna area (mainshock 26/12/2018 Mw = 4.9) and in the island of Ischia (mainshock 21/08/2017 Mw = 3.9), it was possible to increase the number of recordings for volcanic areas in Italy and, in particular, close to the epicentre. The data available after the recent events revealed the limitations of previous models and especially their inadequacy to predict the ground motion observed in the near source, that can be unexpectedly high. We calibrate a new empirical model to predict the amplitudes of several intensity measures for volcanic areas in Italy. The most relevant aspect in the proposed model is the different attenuation with the distance between shallow and deep events, with discerning focal depth fixed at 5 km. The equations are valid for the geometric mean of horizontal components of PGA, PGV and acceleration response spectra ordinates at 5{\%} damping (in period range T = 0.025–5 s). The range of validity in magnitude is 3.5–4.9 and the hypocentral distance range is 1–200 km.},

@article{DiGiacomo2015,
abstract = {This paper outlines the re-computation and compilation of the magnitudes now contained in the final ISC-GEM Reference Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1900-2009). The catalogue is available via the ISC website (www.isc.ac.uk/iscgem/) and lists in a comma separated format the location and magnitude parameters (with corresponding uncertainties) of global large earthquakes. In this work we report on the procedures adopted to obtain the final magnitude composition of the nearly 20,000 earthquakes processed. We have made every effort to use uniform procedures of magnitude determination throughout the entire period of the catalogue. The re-computation of the surface wave MSand short-period body-wave mbvalues benefitted from new hypocentres (Bond{\'{a}}r et al., 2015), previously unavailable amplitude-period data digitized during this project (Di Giacomo et al., 2015), and a more reliable algorithm for magnitude estimation based on a 20{\%} alpha-trimmed median magnitude (Bond{\'{a}}r and Storchak, 2011). In particular, for MSuntil the end of 1970 we have processed an unprecedented amount of data and obtained several thousands of station magnitudes not available before. The available re-computed MSand mbprovided an ideal basis for deriving new conversion relationships to moment magnitude MW. Therefore, rather than using previously published regression models, we derived new empirical relationships using both generalized orthogonal linear and exponential non-linear models to obtain MWproxies from MSand mb. The new models were tested against true values of MW, and the newly derived exponential models were then preferred to the linear ones in computing MWproxies.For the final magnitude composition of the ISC-GEM catalogue, we preferred directly measured MWvalues as published by the Global CMT project for the period 1976-2009 (plus intermediate-depth earthquakes between 1962 and 1975). In addition, over 1000 publications have been examined to obtain direct seismic moment M0and, therefore, also MWestimates for 967 large earthquakes during 1900-1978 (Lee and Engdahl, 2015) by various alternative methods to the current GCMT procedure. In all other instances we computed MWproxy values by converting our re-computed MSand mbvalues into MW, using the newly derived non-linear regression models. The final magnitude composition is an improvement in terms of magnitude homogeneity compared to previous catalogues. The magnitude completeness is not homogeneous over the 110. years covered by the ISC-GEM catalogue. Therefore, seismicity rate estimates may be strongly affected without a careful time window selection. In particular, the ISC-GEM catalogue appears to be complete down to MW5.6 starting from 1964, whereas for the early instrumental period the completeness varies from {\~{}}7.5 to 6.2. Further time and resources would be necessary to homogenize the magnitude of completeness over the entire catalogue length.},

Another means of seismic qualification is by direct integration analysis. Both approaches require a series of time histories as an input. However, in most cases, the possibility of using real earthquake data is limited. Thus, artificial time histories are widely used instead. In many cases, however, response spectra are given. Thus, most of the artificial time histories are generated from the given response spectra. Obtaining the response spectrum from a given time history is straightforward. However, the procedure for generating artificial time histories from a given response spectrum is difficult and complex to understand. Thus, this paper presents a simple time-domain method for generating a time history from a given response spectrum; the method was shown to satisfy conditions derived from nuclear regulatory guidance.},

abstract = {Despite the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is characterized by low to moderate local seismicity, the country is within close proximity to be affected by the surrounding seismically-active regions, mainly, the Zagros and the Makran regions. Appreciable ground shaking levels were felt in many parts of UAE during the past 15 years. A new seismic source model for UAE was specifically developed herein, as a first and significant step towards a critical re-evaluation of the seismic hazard in the UAE. Updated earthquake and focal mechanism catalogs have been incorporated in the definition and characterization of the seismic sources. This was done after unifying magnitudes, seismicity declustering, as well as performing completeness checks. Geological, tectonic, active faults, and crustal thickness information were considered in the delimitation of the source's boundaries. The proposed seismic source model consists of a total of 12 area seismic sources, i.e., 10 shallow-depth (h ≤ 35 km) and 2 intermediate-depth zones (35 {\textless} h ≤ 70 km) spanning the potential seismic regions which may contribute to the UAE seismic hazard. This work is the first in which intermediate-depth seismicity is included in a zoning model for the region. Separate earthquake and focal mechanism sub-catalogs were generated after the delimitation of each defined seismic source. The seismicity occurrence parameters (b-value, annual rate of earthquakes above Mw 4.0, and the maximum possible magnitude) were computed individually for each source. A predominant stress regime was also assigned to each seismic source based on the inversion of the available focal-mechanism data.},

abstract = {Existing predictive equations for absolute durations (both bracketed and uniform) do not take into account the finite probability that durations of zero may be observed for a given set of predictor variables. Consequently, these equations over-predict the expected value of the duration. This note presents a methodology via which these zero values may be appropriately taken into account by treating duration as a censored semicontinuous random variable. The probability of observing a duration of zero is related to the value of peak ground acceleration for each record and this correlation is directly accounted for in the proposed methodology. The extent of over-prediction is demonstrated through an example regression analysis on a subset of the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) project dataset.},

We also include a description of updated computer codes and modeling details. Results show increased ground shaking in many (but not all) locations across the CEUS (up to {\~{}}30{\%}), as well as near the four urban areas overlying deep sedimentary basins in the WUS (up to {\~{}}50{\%}). Due to population growth and these increased hazard estimates, more people live or work in areas of high or moderate seismic hazard than ever before, leading to higher risk of undesirable consequences from forecasted future ground shaking.},

abstract = {While the framework of Gaussian process priors for functions is very flexible and has a number of advantages, its use within a fully Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework has been limited due to computational constraints. Most often, simple models are fit, with hyperparameters learned by maximum likelihood. But this ap-proach understates the posterior uncertainty in inference. We consider priors over kernel hyperparameters, thus inducing a very flexible Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework in which we perform inference using MCMC not just for the posterior function but also for the posterior over the kernel hyperparameters. We address the central challenge of computational efficiency with MCMC by exploiting separable structure in the covariance matrix corresponding to the kernel, yielding significant gains in time and memory efficiency. Our method can be conveniently implemented in a probabilistic programming language (Stan), is widely applicable to any setting involving structured kernels, and immediately enables a number of useful features, including kernel learning through novel prior specifications, learning nonparametric priors over categorical variables, clustering through a factor analysis approach, and missing observations. We demonstrate our methods on real and synthetic spatiotem-poral datasets.},

abstract = {The 1985 prediction of a characteristic magnitude 6 Parkfield earthquake was unsuccessful, since no significant event occurred in the 95{\%} time window (1985-1993) anywhere near Parkfield. The magnitude 6 earthquake near Parkfield in 2004 failed to satisfy the prediction not just because it was late; it also differed in character from the 1985 prediction and was expectable according to a simple null hypothesis. Furthermore, the prediction was too vague in several important respects to meet the accepted definition of an earthquake prediction. An event occurring by chance and meeting the general description of the predicted one was reasonably probable. The original characteristic earthquake model has failed in comprehensive tests, yet it is still widely used. Modified versions employed in recent official seismic hazard calculations allow for interactions between segments and uncertainties in the parameters. With more adjustable parameters, the modified versions are harder to falsify. The characteristic model as applied at Parkfield and elsewhere rests largely on selected data that may be biased because they were taken out of context. We discuss implications of the 2004 event for earthquake prediction, the characteristic earthquake hypothesis, and earthquake occurrence in general.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2012, i6doc.com publication. All rights reserved. In this paper we present a hierarchical model of linear regression functions in the context of multi–task learning. The parameters of the linear model are coupled by a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior, which implies a clustering of related functions for different tasks. To make approximate Bayesian inference under this model we apply the Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (BHC) algorithm. The experiments are conducted on two real world problems: (i) school exam score prediction and (ii) prediction of ground–motion parameters. In comparison to baseline methods with no shared prior the results show an improved prediction performance when using the hierarchical model.},

@article{Chandler2001,
abstract = {The design response spectrum is typically the starting point of most codified seismic design and assessment procedures and is predominantly used to prescribe the applied inertia forces induced by earthquake ground motions. In a recent paper, the authors presented and discussed the key properties, limitations, engineering interpretation and modern concepts relating to various types of earthquake design response spectra, including the acceleration, displacement and velocity spectra. The present paper provides a critical evaluation of the various deterministic and probabilistic approaches to response spectrum modelling, including an introduction to the Component Attenuation Model (CAM). The CAM modelling approach was developed recently by the authors, with the express purpose of providing a novel response spectrum modelling technique for regions lacking earthquake records. Traditional approaches for the prediction of earthquake actions using design response spectra rely on accurate hazard models for the region concerned, which in turn depend heavily on the availability of strong ground motion data from the local seismic region, or from analogous regions with similar geological and seismo-tectonic features. In the case of regions with low to moderate levels of seismicity, such data is at best scarce and in many cases unreliable, and this presents unique problems for designers carrying out seismic analysis for new construction or assessing the seismic reliability of existing buildings, bridges and infrastructure. For such regions, novel approaches (such as CAM) which adapt local seismological information for the purpose of earthquake ground motion modelling may be considered. Further key issues including the determination of the Maximum Considered Earthquake, are also addressed in this paper. KEYWORDS},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. We have produced a uniformly processed database of orientation-independent (RotD50, RotD100) ground motion intensity measurements containing peak horizontal ground motions (accelerations and velocities) and 5-percent-damped pseudospectral accelerations (0.1–10 s) from more than 3,800 M ≥ 3 earthquakes in Oklahoma and Kansas that occurred between January 2009 and December 2016. Ground motion time series were collected from regional, national, and temporary seismic arrays out to 500 km. We relocated the majority of the earthquake hypocenters using a multiple-event relocation algorithm to produce a set of near uniformly processed hypocentral locations. Ground motion processing followed standard methods, with the primary objective of reducing the effects of noise on the measurements. Regional wave propagation features and the high seismicity rate required careful selection of signal windows to ensure that we captured the entire ground motion record and that contaminating signals from extraneous earthquakes did not contribute to the database. Processing was carried out with an automated scheme and resulted in a database comprising more than 174,000 records (https://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F73B5X8N). We anticipate that these results will be useful for improved understanding of earthquake ground motions and for seismic hazard applications.},

abstract = {The conventional approach for developing empirical prediction equations of multivariate ground-motion parameters (e.g., response spectra at a set of vibration periods) is based on regression analysis of the individual parameters; their dependence is subsequently characterized by evaluating the linear correlation coefficient of the logarithm of the ground-motion parameters that are corrected by using a ground-motion prediction equation. A copula technique, which offers a flexible way of describing nonlinear dependence among multivariate data in isolation from their marginal distribution functions, can be used to validate this two-step approach. This new perspective on the multivariate aspects of the development of ground-motion prediction equations is explored through analysis of the strong ground-motion data associated with the Boore and Atkinson (2008) Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research-Next Generation Attenuation of Ground Motions (PEER-NGA) relation. The analysis results demonstrate that multivariate ground-motion parameters can be marginally modeled as a lognormal variate, and their interperiod dependence can be captured by using the normal copula. This finding validates the conventional two-step approach.},

We invert the t* values for three-dimensional (3-D) frequency-independent Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nregional models of the crust. The models have 15 km horizontal grid spacing and an average vertical grid spacing of 4 km, down to 22 km depth, and extend from the U.S.-Mexico border to the Coast Ranges in the south and Sierra Nevada in the north. In general, Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nincrease rapidly with depth, consistent with crustal densities and velocities. The 3-D Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nmodels image the major tectonic structures and to a much lesser extent the thermal structure of the southern California crust. The near-surface low Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nzones coincide with major sedimentary basins such as the San Bernardino, Chino, San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Maria basins and the Salton Trough. In contrast, at shallow depths beneath the Peninsular Ranges, southern Mojave Desert, and southern Sierras, we image high Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$nzones, which correspond to the dense and high-velocity rocks of the mountain ranges. Several clear transition zones of rapidly varying Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$ncoincide with major late Quaternary faults and connect regions of high and low Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nand Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n.

In general, for the southern California crust, Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n/Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nis greater than 1.0, suggesting partially fluid-saturated crust. A few limited regions of Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nS$\backslash$n/Q$\backslash$n$\backslash$nP$\backslash$nless than 1.0 correspond to areas mostly outside the major sedimentary basins, including areas around the San Jacinto fault, suggesting a larger reduction in the shear modulus compared to the bulk modulus or almost complete fluid saturation.},

abstract = {Recent studies to assess very long-term seismic hazard in the United States and in Europe have brought the issue of upper limits on earthquake ground motions into the arena of problems requiring attention from the engineering seismological community. Few engineering projects are considered sufficiently critical to warrant the use of annual frequencies of exceedance so low that ground-motion estimates may become unphysical if limiting factors are not considered, but for nuclear waste repositories, for example, the issue is of great importance. The definition of upper bounds on earthquake ground- motions also presents an exciting challenge for researchers in the area of seismic hazard assessment. This paper looks briefly at historical work on maximum values of ground- motion amplitudes, before illustrating why this is an important issue for hazard assessments at very long return periods. The paper then discusses the factors that control the extreme values of motion, both in terms of generating higher amplitude bedrock motions and in terms of limiting the values of motion at the ground surface. Possible channels of research that could be explored in the quest to define the maximum possible ground motions are also discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. Homogeneous estimates of moment magnitude (M) for small-to-moderate-magnitude (SMM) earthquakes are important to assess regional ground motion compared to global models. However, an estimate of M was available for only 6{\%} of the shallow crustal earthquakes in Iran from 1973 to 2013 in the database developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. Therefore, this study evaluates the existing conversion models, from M L , M s , and m b , to M, for M {\textgreater} 4.0 using the Iranian data set. Correlations between the residuals of these conversions were computed. A weighted estimate for M is presented that combines these conversion models using these correlations based on multivariate statistics. The conversion to M was improved with smaller standard deviations, especially when M L and m b were both available. The inverse-variance–weighted approach, which is common in practice, underestimates the standard deviations because it neglects the positive correlations between these variables.},

The latter is based on the so-called D-vine. We extend the methodology to any regular vine and study the relationship between the multiple correlation and partial correlations on a regular vine. We explain the onion method in terms of elliptical distributions and extend it to allow generating random correlation matrices from the same joint distribution as the vine method. The methods are compared in terms of time necessary to generate 5000 random correlation matrices of given dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Standard errors of earthquake magnitudes are routinely calculated and vary appreciably between earthquakes. However, the uncertainties of magnitude determination are usually ignored in regression models of strong ground motion as a function of magnitude and distance from the earthquake source. This practice has the potential to bias estimates of strong ground motion. A method is given for taking account of the uncertainty of each magnitude determination in fitting such models. It extends previous methods in which the error variance is partitioned into between-earthquake and within-earthquake components. It allows for further decomposition of the between-earthquake component into a part attributable to magnitude uncertainties and a part attributable to other causes. The method has been applied to the well-known attenuation data of Joyner and Boore (1981). The Mw determinations in this dataset fall into two subsets with distinctly different levels of precision, namely, those determined directly and those inferred from values of ML. It is shown that most of the between-earthquake component of variance can be attributed to the relatively low precision of the magnitudes in the latter subset.},

abstract = {Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is currently the soundest basis for the rational evaluation of ground-motion hazard for site-specific engineering design and assessment purposes. An increasing number of building codes worldwide acknowledge the uniform hazard spectra as the reference to determine design actions on structures and to select input ground motions for seismic structural analysis. This is the case, for example, in Italy where the new seismic code also requires the seismic input for nonlinear dynamic analysis to be selected on the basis of dominating events, for example, identified via disaggregation of seismic hazard. In the present study, the design earthquakes expressed in terms of representative magnitude (M), distance (R), and{\{}varepsilon{\}} were investigated for a wide region in the southern Apennines, Italy. To this aim, the hazards corresponding to peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration at 1 sec with a return period of 475 yr were disaggregated. For each of the disaggregation variables the shape of the joint and marginal probability density functions were studied. The first two modes expressed by M, R, and{\{}varepsilon{\}} were extracted and mapped for the study area. The results shown provide additional information, in terms of source and ground-motion parameters, to be used along with the standard hazard maps to better select the design earthquakes. The analyses also allow us to assess how various frequency ranges of the design spectrum are differently contributed by seismic sources in the study area.

abstract = {Horizontal‐component response spectra data for ground motions recorded on hard‐rock sites in eastern North America (ENA) are used to explore the aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in ground‐motion prediction equations (GMPEs). An all‐station sigma, expressing the total calculated scatter of values about a GMPE, ranges from 0.25 to 0.29log10 unit. Single‐station sigmas, in which the scatter is evaluated station by station relative to a regional GMPE, average in the range of 0.23–0.28. The scatter of observations about site‐specific GMPEs (GMPEs developed from multiple events recorded at a single station), which comes the closest to measuring the actual aleatory variability, has average values of 0.22–0.26. Overall, aleatory variability of ground motions in ENA is no larger than that for California, at least for moderate events recorded on hard‐rock sites. Epistemic uncertainty is considered by looking at the standard deviation of GMPEs developed separately for each station (i.e., the scatter of predictions rather than the scatter of observations). This exercise suggests that the overall epistemic uncertainty in ENA GMPEs should be at least 0.15 log unit (as a standard deviation of the median GMPEs) in the magnitude–distance range in which the prediction equations can be anchored by empirical data (magnitude {\textless}5.5, distances {\textgreater}50 km). It should be larger than 0.15 unit at large magnitudes and close distances.},

abstract = {This study investigates the seismic design factors for three reinforced concrete (RC) framed buildings with 4, 16 and 32-stories in Dubai, UAE utilizing nonlinear analysis. The buildings are designed according to the response spectrum procedure defined in the 2009 International Building Code (IBC'09). Two ensembles of ground motion records with 10{\%} and 2{\%} probability of exceedance in 50 years (10/50 and 2/50, respectively) are used. The nonlinear dynamic responses to the earthquake records are computed using IDARC-2D. Key seismic design parameters are evaluated; namely, response modification factor (R), deflection amplification factor (C d), system overstrength factor ($\Omega$ o), and response modification factor for ductility (R d) in addition to inelastic interstory drift. The evaluated seismic design factors are found to significantly depend on the considered ground motion (10/50 versus 2/50). Consequently, resolution to the controversy of Dubai seismicity is urged. The seismic design factors for the 2/50 records show an increase over their counterparts for the 10/50 records in the range of 200{\%}-400{\%}, except for the $\Omega$ o factor, which shows a mere 30{\%} increase. Based on the observed trends, perioddependent R and C d factors are recommended if consistent collapse probability (or collapse prevention performance) in moment frames with varying heights is to be expected. {\textcopyright} 2011 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Systems which display a measurable degree of disorder can be studied efficiently using a probabilistic approach. Different scenarios can be randomly generated with the SFEM to study the behaviour of systems that take into account prior knowledge of the differing variations in properties. This review paper introduces the most commonly used techniques: direct Monte Carlo simulation, the perturbation method and the spectral stochastic finite element method. It then looks at the currently available software for the SFEM and provides examples from the disciplines of materials science, biomechanics and engineering to illustrate different procedures by which the SFEM is practically used. The aim of the paper is to help scientists and engineers quickly assess how they might apply SFEM to their own research and guide them towards key publications.},

Model form uncertainty, inherently existing in selecting the best approximation from a model set cannot be ignored, especially when the predictions by competing models show significant differences. In this research, a methodology based on maximum likelihood estimation is presented to quantify model form uncertainty using the measured differences of experimental and model outcomes, and is compared with a fully Bayesian estimation to demonstrate its effectiveness. While a method called the adjustment factor approach is utilized to propagate model form uncertainty alone into the prediction of a system response, a method called model averaging is utilized to incorporate both model form uncertainty and prediction error into it. A numerical problem of concrete creep is used to demonstrate the processes for quantifying model form uncertainty and implementing the adjustment factor approach and model averaging. Finally, the presented methodology is applied to characterize the engineering benefits of a laser peening process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Large research initiatives such as the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) or the Seismic HAzard haRmonization in Europe (SHARE) projects concentrate a great collaborative effort on defining a global standard for seismic hazard estimations. In this context, there is an increasing need for identifying ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) that can be applied at both global and regional scale. With increasing amounts of strong-motion records that are now available worldwide, observational data can provide a valuable resource to tackle this question. Using the global dataset of Allen and Wald (2009), we evaluate the ability of 11 GMPEs to predict ground-motion in different active shallow crustal regions worldwide. Adopting the approach of Scherbaum et al. (2009), we rank these GMPEs according to their likelihood of having generated the data. In particular, we estimate how strongly data support or reject the models with respect to the state of noninformativeness defined by a uniform weighting. Such rankings derived from this particular global dataset enable us to explore the potential of GMPEs to predict ground motions in their host region and also in other regions depending on the magnitude and distance considered. In the ranking process, we particularly focus on the influence of the distribution of the testing dataset compared with the GMPE's native dataset. One of the results of this study is that some nonindigenous models present a high degree of consistency with the data from a target region. Two models in particular demonstrated a strong power of geographically wide applicability in different geographic regions with respect to the testing dataset: the models of Akkar and Bommer (2010) and Chiou et al. (2010).},

We prove that the estimator has a rare vanishing relative error asymptotic property. Numerical experiments suggest that the scheme proposed is accurate in a wide range of set-ups for which competing estimation schemes fail.

Coefficients describing the decrease in acceleration with increasing distance found by most previous studies of Japanese data are significantly smaller than those found by analyzing individual earthquakes. This phenomeonon is examined and found to result from use of general nonstratified regression analyses. Effects of four different ground condition (rock, hard-, medium- and soft-soils) on the attenuation relation are also examined. Average peak horizontal accelerations for the rock and the soft-soil sites are 60 and 140{\%} respectively of the value predicted from the equation. -from Authors},

abstract = {Ground motions of the South Napa earthquake (24 August 2014; M 6.0) were recorded at 19 stations within 20 km and 292 stations within 100 km of the rupture surface trace, generating peak ground motions in excess of 50{\%}g and 50 cm/s in and near Napa Valley. This large dataset allows us to compare the ground motion from the earthquake to existing ground‐motion prediction equations (GMPEs) in considerable detail. Using the ground‐motion data compiled and reported by ShakeMap (Wald et al., 2000), we examine the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV), as well as the pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) at periods of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 s. At the higher frequencies, especially PGA, data recorded at close distances (within ∼20 km) are very consistent with the GMPEs, implying a stress drop for this event similar to the median for California, that is, 5 MPa (Baltay and Hanks, 2014). At all frequencies, the attenuation with distance is stronger than the GMPEs would predict, which suggests the attenuation in the Napa and San Francisco Bay delta region is stronger than the average attenuation in California. The spatial plot of the ground‐motion residuals is positive to the north, in both Napa and Sonoma Valleys, consistent with increases in amplitude expected from both the directivity and basin effects. More interestingly, perhaps, there is strong ground motion to the south in the along‐strike direction, particularly for PSA at 1.0 s. These strongly positive residuals align with an older, Quaternary fault structure associated with the Franklin or Southampton fault, potentially indicating a fault‐zone‐guided wave.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel scheme for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of Rd. On this approximate eigenbasis, the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as O(nm2) (initial) and O(m3) (hyperparameter learning) with m basis functions and n data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by ∼ 1 / m regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data.},

abstract = {Ground motion intensity measures such as the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and the pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) at two sites due to the same seismic event are correlated. The spatial correlation needs to be considered when modeling ground-motion fields for seismic loss assessments, since it can have a significant influence on the statistical moments and probability distribution of aggregated seismic loss of a building portfolio.Empirical models of spatial correlation of ground motion intensity measures exist only for a few seismic regions in the world such as Japan, Taiwan and California, since for this purpose a dense observation network of earthquake ground motion is required. The Istanbul Earthquake Rapid Response and Early Warning System (IERREWS) provides one such dense array with station spacing of typically 2 km in the urban area of Istanbul. Based on the records of eight small to moderate (Mw3.5-Mw5.1) events, which occurred since 2003 in the Marmara region, we establish a model of intra-event spatial correlation for PGA and PSA up to the natural period of 1.0 s.The results indicate that the correlation coefficients of PGA and short-period PSA decay rapidly with increasing interstation distance, resulting in correlation lengths of approximately 3-4 km, while correlation lengths at longer natural periods (above 0.5 s) exceed 6 km. Finally, we implement the correlation model in a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate economic loss in Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu due to a Mw7.2 scenario earthquake.},

abstract = {In Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis, which has become the basis of decision making on the design of high risk facilities, one estimates the probability that ground motion caused by earthquakes exceeds a certain level at a certain site within a certain time interval. One of the most critical aspects in this context is the model for the conditional probability of ground motion given earthquake magnitude, source-site-distance and potentially additional parameters. These models are usually regression functions, including terms modelling interaction effects derived from expert knowledge. We show that the framework of Directed Graphical Models is an attractive alternative to the standard regression approach. We investigate Bayesian Networks, modelling the problem in a true multivariate way, and we look into Naive Bayes and Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes, where the target node coincides with the dependent variable in standard ground motion regression. Our approach gives rise to distribution-free learning when necessary, and we experiment with and introduce different discretization schemes to apply standard learning and inference algorithms to our problem at hand. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The amount and quality of data used allowed us to measure relevant amplification characteristics. For all earthquakes, the ratios are relatively constant regardless the magnitude, epicentral distance and azimuth of subduction and normal faulting earthquakes. With data recorded at Station Central de Abastos, it is shown that these ratios are a much better approach than horizontal to vertical ratios, which yield only a rough estimation of site amplification. Also for Central de Abastos, where little nonlinear behavior has been observed, an empirical approximation is used to account for these effects. We also built maps of equal amplification that exhibit those zones that have experienced damage during earthquakes and those at the highest risk. The ratios presented here are useful and reliable to accurately predict the amplification of motion.},

abstract = {The seismic ground motion hazard is assessed for a 10{\%} probability of exceedance in 50 years for the three counties (Los Angeles, Ventura, and Orange) impacted by the 1994 Northridge earthquake (Mw 6.7). The earthquake source model of the Southern California Earthquake Center has been modified with additional slip-rate information for mapped faults and blind thrusts and incorporated into seismic hazard maps that will be used for making regional hazard and risk mitigation decisions by state and local government agencies. Peak horizontal ground acceleration (pga) and 5{\%} damped spectral acceleration (SA) (0.3 and 1 sec) were calculated with three equally weighted attenuation relationships of Boore et al. (1993), Campbell and Bozorgnia (1994), and Sadigh (written comm., 1994). The results of this assessment indicate high hazard over the entire tri-county area with ground motions exceeding 0.4 g (pga), 1.0 g (0.3-sec SA), and 0.5 g (1-sec SA) nearly everywhere. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is described for two sites located in Los Angeles and Northridge. This analysis yields 95{\%} confidence limits for peak ground acceleration at the two sites that range between {\{}+/-{\}}0.1 and {\{}+/-{\}}0.2 g. Our calculations indicate that the uncertainty in the magnitude-rupture length relations, magnitude distribution, moment-magnitude relation, attenuation relation, and slip-rate contribute most to the hazard uncertainty at these sites and that the highest uncertainties in the mapped ground motion are associated with the strongest anticipated ground motions.},

Application of gravity gradiometry to observations by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission results in the identification of a population of linear gravity anomalies with lengths of hundreds of kilometers. Inversion of the gravity anomalies indicates elongated positive density anomalies interpreted to be ancient vertical tabular intrusions or dikes, formed by magmatism in combination with extension of the lithosphere. Crosscutting relationships support a pre-Nectarian to Nectarian age, preceding the end of the heavy bombardment of the Moon. The distribution, orientation, and dimensions of the intrusions indicate a globally isotropic extensional stress state arising from an increase in the Moon's radius by 0.6 to 4.9 km early in lunar history, consistent with predictions of thermal models.},

These deep structures are probability distributions, designed through hierarchical construction, which are conditionally Gaussian. In this paper, the current published body of work is placed in a common framework and, through recursion, several classes of deep Gaussian processes are defined. The resulting samples generated from a deep Gaussian process have a Markovian structure with respect to the depth parameter, and the effective depth of the resulting process is interpreted in terms of the ergodicity, or non-ergodicity, of the resulting Markov chain. For the classes of deep Gaussian processes introduced, we provide results concerning their ergodicity and hence their effective depth. We also demonstrate how these processes may be used for inference; in particular we show how a Metropolis-within-Gibbs construction across the levels of the hierarchy can be used to derive sampling tools which are robust to the level of resolution used to represent the functions on a computer. For illustration, we consider the effect of ergodicity in some simple numerical examples.},

abstract = {Spatial modeling of ground motion intensity measures (IMs) is required for risk assessment of spatially distributed engineering systems. For example, when a lifeline system is of concern, classical site-specific hazard tools, which treat IMs at different locations independently, may not be adequate to accurately assess the seismic risk. In fact, in this case, modeling of ground motion as a random field is required; it basically consists of assigning a correlation structure to the IM of interest. This work focuses on semiempirical estimation of the correlation coefficient, as a function of intersite separation distance, between residuals with respect to ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) of horizontal peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV). In particular, subsets of the European Strong-Motion Database (ESD) and the Italian Accelerometric Archive (ITACA) were employed to evaluate the intraevent residual correlation based on multiple earthquakes, considering different GMPEs fitted to the same records. The analyses were carried out through geostatistical tools, which enabled results to be found that are generally consistent between the two datasets. Correlation for PGV appears to attenuate more gradually with respect to PGA. In order to better understand the dependency of the results on the adopted estimation approach and dataset, some aspects related to the working hypotheses are critically discussed. Finally, estimated correlation models are used to develop illustrative applications of regional probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis.},

abstract = {Based on the results obtained by analysing a large number of dynamic strike slip and dipping fault ruptures we construct a kinematic rupture model generator that incorporates some of the key source parameters extracted from the dynamic rupture models. In this kinematic rupture model, the slip rate function includes the final slip, the rise time, the local rupture velocity and the peak time (a measure of the impulsive part of the slip rate function). A four-dimensional correlation matrix is used to describe the spatial interdependency between the four source parameters-each of which is modelled as correlated random field. Each source parameter has a different marginal distribution determined from the analysis of the dynamic models. The marginal distributions are allowed to change as a function of distance from the hypocentre. The autocorrelation of each parameter is modelled by a power spectrum that follows a power law. The value of the spectral decay of the power law for the different source parameters is based on the results obtained from the dynamic rupture models. Finally, the values of rise time and peak time are adjusted such that the moment rate function fits a Brune spectrum for a specified corner frequency. We validate the rupture model generator using observed strong motion near field recording for the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. We perform comparisons with the rupture model generator of Liu et al. We find that only considering the response spectral bias of a best model is not sufficient to validate a rupture model generator. Thus we test the predictive power of the two rupture model generators if multiple ruptures are computed. Overall, the new rupture model generator yields a better prediction, compared to Liu et al., for the two validation events, especially in predicting observed PGV values and pseudospectral velocity at low frequencies ( {\textless} 1Hz). {\textcopyright} The Authors 2012.

abstract = {In his opinion paper " Earthquake Hazard Maps and Objective Testing: The Hazard Mapper's Point of View, " Stirling (2012) makes the claim that probabilistic seismic hazard (PSH) maps " are tools developed to provide estimates of hazard for long return periods (e.g., hundreds to thousands of years) " (p. 231). He is referring to the applications of PSH models for nuclear facilities and hydro dam developments as successful examples of the probabilistic method. Stirling is recommending PSH applications such as the Yucca Mountain seismic project also for other areas. Despite Stirling's opinion, PSH maps in use today ob-viously should not be used for reasons noted here. Because such maps provide the basis for national seismic building codes in many countries, it is instructive to comment on such opinions from the perspective of a risk-analysis professional and a con-tributor to the current International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safety guide for seismic hazard analysis (IAEA, 2010). I will show that the PSH model currently in use does not pro-vide information on the explicit occurrence time dependency of earthquakes' ground motions, neither for short nor for long-er return periods, and that deviation of the observed seismic ground motions from PSH maps is a systematic characteristic of the applied methodology. PSH MODEL AND TIME DEPENDENCY Equation ((1)) shows the PSH model for a single seismic source for the calculation of the frequency of exceedance, $\lambda$ a $\lambda$ a  $\upsilon$ Z m u m 0 Z r∞ r0 f 1 mf 2 rjmP A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i drdm; (1) where v the mean rate of occurrence of earthquakes within the lower m 0 and the upper m u magnitude bounds,f 1 m is the magnitude recurrence relation, f 2 rjm is the distribution of distance between site and earthquake location (e.g., epicenter) for a given magnitude,P A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i  is the probability of exceedance that the predicted ground-motion-level A Pred exceeds the level a, and X i denotes other factors considered in the ground-motion model forming the basis for the calculation of the exceedance probability. Looking at the model, it is obvious that only the term vf 1 m can be related to a time dependency because of the assumed recurrence model of earthquakes. Typically a homo-geneous Poisson process of earthquake occurrence is assumed (Reiter, 1991). There are many unresolved issues regarding this assumption (Kl{\"{u}}gel, 2008) that will not be commented on here. All other characteristics in equation (1) are essentially spatial characteristics. They measure the chance that for a given point in space the ground-motion level a is exceeded. The probability P A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i  is by definition ≤ 1. There-fore, the PSH model does not reflect time dependency of seis-mic ground motions even for the simplest case of a single seismic source. The probability of exceedance P A Pred {\textgreater} ajm; r; X i  is cal-culated (ignoring upper bound ground-motion truncation and assuming a lognormal distribution of ground motions, the cur-rent standard model of probabilistic seismic hazard [PSHA]) as},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model is widely used to describe the self-exciting nature of earthquake occurrences. While traditional inference methods provide only point estimates of the model parameters, we aim at a full Bayesian treatment of model inference, allowing naturally to incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty quantification of the resulting estimates. Therefore, we introduce a highly flexible, non-parametric representation for the spatially varying ETAS background intensity through a Gaussian process (GP) prior. Combined with classical triggering functions this results in a new model formulation, namely the GP-ETAS model. We enable tractable and efficient Gibbs sampling by deriving an augmented form of the GP-ETAS inference problem. This novel sampling approach allows us to assess the posterior model variables conditioned on observed earthquake catalogues, i.e., the spatial background intensity and the parameters of the triggering function. Empirical results on two synthetic data sets indicate that GP-ETAS outperforms standard models and thus demonstrate the predictive power for observed earthquake catalogues including uncertainty quantification for the estimated parameters. Finally, a case study for the l'Aquila region, Italy, with the devastating event on 6 April 2009, is presented.},

Efficient discretization of continuous attributes is an important problem that has effects on speed, accuracy and understandability of the induction models.

This results in the definition of a Bayes optimal evaluation criterion of discretizations. We then propose a new super-linear optimization algorithm that manages to find near-optimal discretizations. Extensive comparative experiments both on real and synthetic data demonstrate the high inductive performances obtained by the new discretization method.},

The input models are improved from those implemented in 2008 by using new ground motion models that have incorporated about twice as many earthquake strong ground shaking data and by incorporating many additional scientific studies that indicate broader ranges of earthquake source and ground motion models. These time-independent maps are shown for 2-percent and 10-percent probability of exceedance in 50 years for peak horizontal ground acceleration as well as 5-hertz and 1-hertz spectral accelerations with 5-percent damping on a uniform firm rock site condition (760 meters per second shear wave velocity in the upper 30 m, VS30). In this report, the 2014 updated maps are compared with the 2008 version of the maps and indicate changes of plus or minus 20 percent over wide areas, with larger changes locally, caused by the modifications to the seismic source and ground motion inputs.},

@article{Jayaram2010a,
abstract = {Ground-motion models are commonly used in earthquake engineering to predict the probability distribution of the ground-motion intensity at a given site due to a particular earthquake event. These models are often built using regression on observed ground-motion intensities and are fitted using either the one-stage mixed- effects regression algorithm proposed by Abrahamson and Youngs (1992) or the two- stage algorithm of Joyner and Boore (1993). In their current forms, these algorithms ignore the spatial correlation between intraevent residuals. This paper emphasizes the theoretical importance of considering spatial correlation while fitting ground- motion models and proposes an extension to the Abrahamson and Youngs (1992) algorithm that allows the consideration of spatial correlation. By refitting the Campbell and Bozorgnia (2008) ground-motion model using the mixed-effects regression algorithm considering spatial correlation, it is apparent that the variance of the total residuals and the ground-motion model coefficients used for predicting the median ground-motion intensity are not significantly different from the published values even after the incorporation of spatial correlation. However, there is an increase in the variance of the intraevent residual and a significant decrease in the variance of the interevent residual. These changes have implications for risk assess- ments of spatially-distributed systems because a smaller interevent residual variance implies lesser likelihood of observing large ground-motion intensities at all sites in a region.},

The nonlinear components depend upon the earthquake scenario being considered implicitly through the use of the expected level of excitation at some reference horizon. The linear components are always assumed to be independent of the earthquake scenario. This article presents empirical and numerical evidence as well as a theoretical explanation for why the linear component of site response depends upon the magnitude and distance of the earthquake scenario. Although the impact is most pronounced for small-magnitude scenarios, the finding has significant implications for a number of applications of more general interest including the development of site-response terms within ground-motion models, the estimation of ground-motion variability components ϕS2S and ϕSS, the construction of partially nonergodic models for site-specific hazard assessments, and the validity of the convolution approach for computing surface hazard curves from those at a reference horizon, among others. All of these implications are discussed in the present article.},

abstract = {We consider problems involving groups of data where each observation within a group is a draw from a mixture model and where it is desirable to share mixture components between groups. We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the “Chinese restaurant franchise.” We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling.},

Data were collected by a 10-station portable seismic network deployed by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica (Rome, Italy) shortly after the occurrence of the first mainshock of the sequence, on 26 September 1997. Among the thousands of events recorded, we selected 142 earthquakes characterized by good signal-to-noise ratios at all frequencies, and by the absence of multiple shocks within the time window spanned by each recording. The data set of the selected waveforms was made of 2030 horizontal-component seismograms. The logarithm of the peak values of narrow bandpass-filtered versions of the velocity time histories are modeled at each frequency as AMP(f, r) = EXC(f, r(ref)) + SITE(f) + D(r, r(ref), f). EXC(f,r(ref),=) is the excitation term at an arbitrary reference hypocentral distance, r(ref); SITE(f) is a site term. The empirical attenuation functional, D(r,r(ref),f), represents an estimate of the average crustal response for the region, at the hypocentral distance r, at the frequency f. It is modeled by using the following functional form: D(r, r(ref), f) = log g(r) - log g(r(ref)) - pi f(r-r(ref))/beta Q(0)(f/f(ref))(eta); (f(ref) = 1.0 Hz, r(ref) = 10 km). g(r) = r(-1) is the body-wave geometrical spreading function; beta = 3.5 km/sec is the shear-wave velocity in the crust. Due to the constraints applied to the system prior to the regressions, the excitation term represents the expected peak ground motion at the reference distance, as it would be observed at a site representative of the average site response of the network. The random vibration theory (RVT) is used to obtain a theoretical prediction of the attenuation functional. For reproducing D(r,r(ref), f) we use the crustal attenuation parameter Q(f) = 130(f/f(ref))(0.10) obtained by Malagnini et al. (2000) from the analysis of a regional data set representative of the entire Apennines, in the (0.24-5.0 Hz) band. Two parameters are used to predict shapes and levels of the seismic spectra, the stress drop Delta sigma, and a high-frequency attenuation parameter KO The values used to reproduce the observed velocity spectra are Delta sigma = 200 bars; kappa(0) = 0.04 sec. The indicated stress drop was estimated in this region by Castro et al. (2000), on recordings of the largest shock of the Umbria-Marche sequence.},

abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal " slice " defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such " slice sampling " methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by " overrelaxation, " and for multivariate slice sampling by " reflection " from the edges of the slice.},

abstract = {The geological complexity of northern California and its accreted ter-ranes produces pronounced regional variations in the attenuation (1=Q) of earthquake waves. Using local earthquakes, 3D Q P and Q S models have been obtained for this region that includes the San Andreas fault system, the Great Valley, the Sierra Nevada batholith, and the Gorda subduction volcanic system. Path attenuation t values were determined from P and S spectra of 959 spatially distributed earthquakes, magnitude 2.5–6.0, using 1254 stations from Northern California Earthquake Data Center net-works and Mendocino and Sierra Nevada temporary arrays. The t data were used in Q inversions, using existing 3D velocity models and basic 10 km node spacing. Un-even data coverage was accommodated with linking nodes into larger areas for useful Q images across the 3D volume. Results at shallow depth show very low Q in the Sacramento Delta, the Eureka area, and parts of the San Francisco Bay area. In the brittle crust, low Q tends to be associated with regions of fault zones and microearth-quakes. In the ductile lower crust, low Q is observed below fault zones with large cumulative displacement and inferred grain size reduction, with apparent broad ductile shear zones across the fault system in the Coast Ranges. Underlying active arc volcanoes, low Q features are apparent below 20 km depth. Under the Long Valley caldera, two distinct partial melt features at ∼3 and ∼15 km depth are inferred. Mod-erately high Q is associated with Sierra Nevada and Salinian igneous rocks, whereas the Franciscan subduction complex shows moderately low Q. Prominent high Q re-lates to the Great Valley ophiolite. The pattern of path-specific attenuation rate, from 3D Q, is generally similar to the pattern of psuedospectral acceleration residuals for the South Napa earthquake, indicating that it may be beneficial to incorporate 3D Q models into future ground-motion prediction equations for northern California.},

abstract = {We use body-waveformmodelling to constrain the source parameters of earthquakes occurring globally in oceanic lithosphere beneath the subduction zone outer rise and outer trench slope. These data are then used to map the stress state in the lithosphere of the downgoing plate as it bends into the subduction zone. Our results provide new constraints on the faulting of oceanic lithosphere at the outer rise, which is important for understanding the transmission of platedriving forces through the subduction system. In all cases, shallownormal-faulting earthquakes are observed at the top of the plate, and are separated in depth from any deeper thrust-faulting earthquakes. No temporal variation associated with large thrust-faulting earthquakes on the subduction interface is seen in the depth extent of each type of faulting at the outer rise. The transition depth from trench-normal extension to compression is found to vary in agreement with models in which deformation is driven by the combination of in-plane stresses and bending stresses, resulting principally from slab pull. Combining the seismologically derived constraints on the thickness of the elastic core of the plate with estimates of the plate curvature, we place upper bounds on the strength of the lithosphere at the outer rise, which is required to be {\textless}300MPa for a constant yield stress model, or governed by an effective coefficient of friction of {\textless}0.3. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2014.

abstract = {Most of earthquake early warning systems are conceived as either regional or on-site systems. A new concept is the integration of these approaches for the definition of alert levels and the estimation of the earthquake Potential Damage Zone (PDZ). The key element of the method is the real-time, simultaneous measurement of initial peak displacement (Pd) and period parameter (TAUc) for a 3-second window after the first P-arrival time at accelerometer stations located at increasing distances from the epicenter. As for the on-site approach the recorded values of Pd and TAUc are compared to threshold values, which are set for a minimum magnitude Mw 6 and instrumental intensity Imm VII, according to empirical regression analysis of strong motion data from different seismic regions. At each recording site the alert level is assigned based on a decisional table with four entries defined by critical values of the parameters Pd and TAUc. A regional network of stations provides the event location and transmits the information about the alert levels recorded at near-source stations to more distant sites, before the arrival of the most destructive phase. We present the results of performance tests of this method using ten, Mw {\textgreater} 6 Japanese earthquakes, and propose a very robust methodology for mapping the PDZ in the first seconds after a moderate-to-large earthquake. The studied cases displayed a very good matching between the rapidly predicted and observed damage zone, the latter being mapped a few days after the event from detailed macro-seismic surveys.},

Previous studies have found a systematic difference between short-period ground motions from aftershocks and main shocks, but have not used a consistent methodology for classifying earthquakes in strong motion data sets. A method for unambiguously classifying earthquakes in strong motion data sets is developed. The classification is based on the Gardner and Knopoff time window, but with a distance window based on a new distance metric, CR JB , defined as the shortest horizontal distance between the centroid of the surface projection of the potential aftershock rupture plane and the surface projection of the main shock rupture plane. Class 2 earthquakes are earthquakes that have a CR JB distance less than a selected limit and within a time window appropriate for aftershocks. All other earthquakes are classified as Class 1. For maximum CR JB of 0 km and 40 km, 11{\%} and 36{\%} of the earthquakes in the NGA-West2 database are Class 2 events, respectively.},

We formally derive a criterion based on the Minimal Description Length principle for choosing the threshold values for the discretization. This new metric embodies a tradeoff between the complexity of the learned discretization, the complexity of the Bayesian network, and the fitness of the network as a model of the training data. This metric has the attractive property of decomposition: the discretization of each variable depends only on the interactions between the variable and its local neighborhood in the network. We examine other properties of this metric that are relevant to the computation of a discretization policy and propose an iterative algorithm for learning a policy. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the discretization in applications to both supervised and unsupervised learning.},

Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.},

The assumption in this context, that the candidate models form a partition of a finite categorical model set, however, poses severe limitations in dealing with model redundancy. Here we demonstrate how these limitations can be overcome by representing models (here ground-motion models) as high-dimensional model feature vectors that can be thought of as spanning a two-dimensional model manifold in a high-dimensional space. The structure of this manifold can be analysed through a combination of SOM and Sammon's mapping. Using an information-theoretic distance metric for the generation of the SOMs results in information-based proximity maps that then represent epistemic uncertainty on the underlying models on a continuous interval scale. Here individual models can be seen as samples of a continuous model domain on which model redundancy is no longer an issue. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {We produce probabilistic seismic-hazard assessments for the central Apennines, Italy, using time-dependent models that are characterized using a Brownian passage time recurrence model. Using aperiodicity parameters,{\{}alpha{\}} of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, we examine the sensitivity of the probabilistic ground motion and its deaggregation to these parameters. For the seismic source model we incorporate both smoothed historical seismicity over the area and geological information on faults. We use the maximum magnitude model for the fault sources together with a uniform probability of rupture along the fault (floating fault model) to model fictitious faults to account for earthquakes that cannot be correlated with known geologic structural segmentation. We show maps for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 1.0 Hz spectral acceleration (SA1) on rock having 10{\%} probability of exceedence in 50 yr. We produce maps to compare the separate contributions of smoothed seismicity and fault components. In addition we construct maps that show sensitivity of the hazard for different{\{}alpha{\}} parameters and the Poisson model. For the Poisson model the addition of fault sources to the smoothed seismicity raises the hazard by 50{\%} at locations where the smoothed seismicity contributes the highest hazard and up to 100{\%} at locations where the hazard from smoothed seismicity is low. For the strongest aperiodicity parameter (smallest{\{}alpha{\}} ), the hazard may further increase 60{\%}-80{\%} or more or may decrease by as much as 20{\%} depending on the recency of the last event on the fault that dominates the hazard at a given site. In order to present the most likely earthquake magnitude and/or the most likely source-site distance for scenario studies, we deaggregate the seismic hazard for SA1 and PGA for two important cities (Rome and L'Aquila). For PGA both locations show the predominance of local sources having magnitudes of about 5.3 and 6.5, respectively. For SA1 at a site in Rome, there is significant contribution from local smoothed seismicity and an additional contribution from the more distant Apennine faults having magnitude around 6.8. For L'Aquila the predominant sources remain local. In order to show the variety of impact of different{\{}alpha{\}} values, we also obtained deaggregations for another three sites. In general, as{\{}alpha{\}} decreases (periodicity increases), the deaggregation indicates that the hazard is highest near faults with the highest earthquakes rates. This effect is strongest for the long-period (1 sec) ground motions.

The composite source consists of sub-events with a distribution of sizes, distributed randomly on the fault. In this paper, we extend our discussion of the source by allowing subevent rake to vary within the positive strain quadrant and by including the effect of the random lateral heterogeneity of the earth by adding scattered waves into the Green's function computed from a layered elastic earth model. Both of these variations contribute towards equalizing different components of the high frequency waveform train. The random scattering has the stronger effect on increasing the amplitudes of the nodal components. The early part of these scattered coda waves also tends to elongate the strong shaking of the earthquake.},

In the analysis, 856 data for peak ground acceleration and 394 data for peak ground velocity are used, including those recorded in the near-source area. In the study, the earthquakes are classified into three groups, i.e., crustal, inter-plate and intra-plate earthquakes, according to the fault type. The site effects are evaluated quantitatively, and the path effects are evaluated by using two types of distance measurements, such as fault distance and equivalent hypocentral distance. The new attenuation relationships show that an intra-plate earthquake generates stronger acceleration and velocity than inter-plate and crustal events. The results also show that the earthquake with deeper focal depth generates stronger ground motion.},

The average response spectra of the simulated ground motions were calculated and compared with observed ground motions to determine whether stochastic finite-fault modeling can reproduce key features of the recorded motions. To account for variations in source characteristics, we examined three rupture-process models: a single-event model with random slip distribution, a single-event model with prescribed slip distribution (Yagi, 2011; see Data and Resources), and a multiple-event model with five strong-motion generation areas (Kurahashi and Irikura, 2011). The analysis results indicate that the single-event models can model the highfrequency response spectra values well but result in significant model bias in the low-frequency range. By contrast, the multiple-event model produces ground motions that are in good agreement with the observations in both high- and low-frequency ranges. Furthermore, the multiple-event model can capture temporal characteristics of observed ground motions, including multiphase arrivals of major seismic-wave groups. Importantly, the calibrated EXSIM model for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake can be used to produce predicted ground motions in other regions, such as the Cascadia subduction region of North America, by suitable modifications of regional attenuation and site parameters. The suitability of the simple stochastic simulation method to prediction of motions for future events, the details of which are poorly known, makes its calibration to Tohoku a useful exercise.},

abstract = {Source-scaling relations are an integral component of probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis (PSHA). These models that enable finite-rupture dimensions to be computed for a given earthquake scenario provide the link between magnitude- frequency distributions and ground-motion models. However, the development of scaling relations has not traditionally been undertaken in a manner that is consistent with their application within the hazard analysis. The causative problem is that rupture widths saturate as a result of the limited seismogenic thickness in any given region. This saturation has not previously been dealt with in a consistent manner, either in the development of scaling relations or in their typical application. This article approaches the development of source-scaling relations for shallow crustal earthquakes in active regions in an entirely new way that results in models that are physically consistent and consistent with the assumptions of PSHA. The innovative treatment of the width saturation issue results in new models that feature nonlinear scaling of the expected values, as well as strongly heteroskedastic variances. The first set of correlation coefficients is also provided for the rupture dimensions so that their joint variability can be appropriately accounted for within PSHA. The findings of the article have significant implications for hazard analysis, as the conditional distribution of finite-rupture distances for a given magnitude differs quite markedly from those suggested by existing approaches.},

However, because of the triggering threshold of the strong-motion station, ground motion records below the triggering threshold are truncated (i.e., not recorded), and the truncated intensity levels of spectral accelerations at different periods are random variables. Consequently, the sampling of the ground motion data used in GMPE development is biased, and the observed probability of the intensity measurement is no longer normally distributed. Therefore, a novel two-step maximum-likelihood method is proposed in this paper as a regression tool to overcome this problem in GMPE development. The advantage of the proposed method is that the correlation between records from the same events and those from the same sites as well as the biased sampling problem can be considered simultaneously, and more ground motion data can be considered to derive more reliable analysis results.},

abstract = {The New Zealand Strong Motion Database provides a wealth of new strong motion data for engineering applications. In order to utilise these data in ground motion prediction, characterisation of key site parameters at each of the {\~{}}497 past and present GeoNet strong motion stations represented in the database is required. Here, we present the compilation of a complete set of site metadata for the New Zealand database, including four key parameters: i) NZS1170.5 site subsoil classification, ii) the time-averaged shear-wave velocity to a depth of 30 m (Vs30), iii) fundamental site period (Tsite) and iv) depth to a shear-wave velocity of 1000 m/s (Z1.0, a proxy for depth to bedrock). In addition, we have assigned a quality estimate (Quality 1 – 3) to each numerical parameter to provide a qualitative estimate of the uncertainty. New high-quality Tsite, Vs30 and Z1.0 estimates have been obtained from a variety of recent studies, and reconciled with available geological information. This database will be used in efforts to guide development and testing of new and existing ground motion prediction models in New Zealand, allowing re-examination of the most important site parameters that control site response in a New Zealand setting. Preliminary analyses, using the newly compiled data, suggest that high quality site parameters can reduce uncertainty in ground motion prediction. Furthermore, the database can be used to identify suitable rock reference sites for seismological research, and as a guide to more detailed site-specific references in the literature. The database provides an additional resource for informing engineering design, however it is not suitable as a replacement for site-specific assessment.},

abstract = {Disaggregation of seismic hazard provides the relative contributions to hazards from sources of different magnitude, distance, and epsilon. It is extended in this study to the disaggregation of annualized loss ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the average total annual value loss of an ensemble of properties to the total original value of those properties. Seismic hazard is usually disaggregated with a given ground-motion value at a spectral frequency or with ground-motion values of certain mean return period and spectral frequency. Hence, the results of seismic-hazard disaggregation depend on the given ground motion. The results are very useful for engineers to select a single "design earthquake." However, as shown herein, if the seismic sources have recurrence times very different from the mean return period of the given ground motions, their relative contributions are suppressed and may be missed completely. For some applications, such as in the residential home insurance industry, this is not desirable. The annualized loss ratio disaggregation is performed using the whole hazard curve together with the building-response curve. It does not have the limitations of being dependent on the given ground motion and may be more appropriate for some applications such as home insurance. Seismic-hazard disaggregation may be extended not only to annualized loss ratio, which is the result of the structural vulnerability exposed to hazard, but also to the measures of loss due to other hazards like liquefaction and landslide as well. Specially designed measures for losses of these hazards, similar to the annualized loss ratio for disaggregation, are needed.

abstract = {A seismic hazard evaluation in terms of 5{\%} damped peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration was carried out for the Arabian Peninsula using a probabilistic approach. For this purpose, a revised earthquake catalogue extending from 19 AD to 2015 AD was utilized, including all available earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.0. The seismic hazard assessment was conducted in the framework of the logic-tree approach to take into account epistemic uncertainties associated with input parameters [seismic source model, recurrence parameters, maximum magnitude, and ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs)]. A novel seismic source model consisting of 57 seismic zones is proposed as an alternative included in the modeled logic tree. The recurrence parameters were computed mainly using the doubly bounded exponential distribution. Horizontal ground motion in terms of geometric mean acceleration was computed for different spectral periods utilizing GMPEs borrowed from tectonic environments comparable to those surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. The 5{\%} damped seismic hazard values at bedrock conditions were calculated for return periods of 475, 975, and 2475 years. Additionally, uniform hazard spectra for important population centers in the Arabian Peninsula are provided. The highest seismic hazard values were observed along the Zagros, the East Anatolian Fault, and the Gulf of Aqaba–Dead Sea Fault. The provided maps could be used to design the Unified Gulf Building Code.},

abstract = {Empirical correlations of horizontal peak spectral amplitudes (PSA) are modeled using the total-residuals obtained in a ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) regression. Recent GMPEs moved toward partially non-ergodic region- and site-specific predictions, while the residual correlation models remained largely ergodic. Using mixed-effects regression, we decompose the total-residuals of a pan-European GMPE into between-event, between-site, and event-and-site corrected residuals to investigate the ergodicity in empirical PSA correlations. We first observed that the between-event correlations are magnitude-dependent, partially due to the differences in source spectra, and influence of stress-drop parameter on small and large events. Next, removing the between-site residuals from within-event residuals yields the event-and-site corrected residuals which are found to be region-dependent, possibly due to the regional differences in distance-decay of short period PSAs. Using our site-corrected magnitude- and region-dependent correlations, and the between-site residuals as empirical site-specific ground motion adjustments, we compute partially non-ergodic conditional mean spectra at four well-recorded sites in Europe and Middle Eastern regions. 09{\_}EERI{\_}33{\_}4{\_}Suppl{\_}ES1{\_}Online.xlsx},

abstract = {High-resolution maps of large continental strike-slip earthquake surface ruptures show that they are formed of fault segments. These segments are bounded by fault bends, step overs, or combinations of the two. The lowest limit in size for such segments may not be relevant in the understanding of earthquake mechanics, as it pertains to the granular properties of fault zones. The maximum limit in segment length, however, is important as it is directly relates to the maximum extent of seismic rupture. To measure the length of the segments, a new quantitative method based on piecewise linear fitting is developed and is used to automatically retrieve segments from earthquake rupture maps. Next, this approach is tested against a set of ten continental strike-slip earthquake ruptures derived from similar, high quality maps. The test suggests that segments have a maximum length of ∼18 km, independent of regional tectonic setting. Slip-inversions for earthquakes, based on seismological and/or geodetic data, most often are not unique and can show some variability even for one particular event. Some basic characteristics, however, such as total moment release or general source geometry, seem to persist that are relevant to earthquake mechanics. Measurements of the maximum horizontal extent of individual slip-patches derived from seismic source inversion for strike-slip ruptures show that their strike dimension does not increase infinitely with magnitude, but instead reaches a maximum value of ∼25 km. These two independent lines of observations, complemented by earlier data and analog experiments, suggest that it is the thickness of the seismogenic crust that controls the structural scaling of the length of seismic segments, and that it is independent of the ultimate size of individual earthquakes. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Seismological Society of America. All rights reserved. This article presents the development of ground-motion prediction equations for the maximum rotated (RotD100) horizontal component of five intensity measures: Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, cumulative absolute velocity above the 5 cm/s 2 threshold (CAV 5 ), standardized cumulative absolute velocity (CAV STD ), and peak incremental ground velocity. The equations predict the ground-motion intensity at outcropping rock sites. This scope reflects the critical importance of outcropping rock-motion properties that can be employed as predictors of certain site-response quantities or used as input to site-response and soil–structure interaction analyses. We present equations for the shallow crustal, intraplate, and subduction tectonic environments and between- and within-event standard deviations for each. We also provide supplemental logistic models predicting the probability that CAV 5 and CAV STD exceed zero in a given earthquake scenario. These equations are valid for magnitudes between 4.0 and 9.0 and source-to-site distances up to 400 km, depending on the tectonic environment.},

abstract = {The selection of ground motion models, and the representation of their epistemic uncertainty in the form of a logic tree, is one of the fundamental components of probabilistic seismic hazard and risk analysis. A new ground motion model (GMM) logic tree has been developed for the 2020 European seismic hazard model, which develops upon recently compiled ground motion data sets in Europe. In contrast to previous European seismic hazard models, the new ground model logic tree is built around the scaled backbone concept. Epistemic uncertainties are represented as calibrations to a reference model and aim to characterise the potential distributions of median ground motions resulting from variability in source scaling and attenuation. These scaled backbone logic trees are developed and presented for shallow crustal seismic sources in Europe. Using the new European strong motion flatfile, and capitalising on recent perspectives in ground motion modelling in the scientific literature, a general and transferable procedure is presented for the construction of a backbone model and the regionalisation of epistemic uncertainty. This innovative approach forms a general framework for revising and updating the GMM logic tree at national and European scale as new strong motion data emerge in the future.},

Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches, especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation.},

A total of 134 of these events (49{\%}) have been classified as occurring in the overlying crust, with 33 events (12{\%}) located on the Fiordland subduction interface and 7 on the Hikurangi subduction interface (3{\%}). 8 events (3{\%}) are deemed to have occurred within the subducting Australian Plate at the Fiordland subduction zone, and 94 events (34{\%}) within the subducting Pacific Plate on the Hikurangi subduction zone. There are a total of 4,148 uniformly-processed recordings associated with these earthquakes, from which acceleration, velocity and displacement time-series, Fourier amplitude spectra of acceleration, and acceleration response spectra have been computed. 598 recordings from the New Zealand database are identified as being suitable for future use in time-domain analyses of structural response.

The candidate models were chosen from three categories: local models that were developed based on the local data, regional models corresponding to Europe and Middle East data sets, and finally NGA (Next Generation Attenuation) models. Two different statistical approaches were applied for evaluation of these models, the first being the likelihood method, and the second the average log-likelihood method (LH and LLH). One of the most significant results of this study is that local ground motion models show more consistency with the recorded data than do NGA models. {\textcopyright} 2012 A. S. Elnashai {\&} N. N.

@article{VanDinther2019,
abstract = {S U M M A R Y Our physical understanding of earthquakes, along with our ability to forecast them, is hampered by limited indications on the current and future state of stress on faults. Integrating indirect observations, laboratory experiments and physics-based numerical modelling to quantitatively estimate this evolution is crucial. However, quantitative integrations are tenuous in light of the scarcity and uncertainty of observations and the difficulty of modelling the physics governing earthquakes. We show that observations and prior physical knowledge, along with their errors, can be efficiently integrated through the statistical framework of ensemble data assimilation (EDA), which is adopted from weather forecasting. To evaluate whether fault stress estimation and forecasting is possible, we perform a perfect model test in a subduction zone setup that mimicks a scaled laboratory experiment. Synthetic noised data on velocities and stresses from one point near the surface are assimilated using an Ensemble Kalman Filter. These data update the velocity and stress states throughout 150 ensemble members, whose dynamics is governed by a seismic cycle model. This visco-elasto-plastic forward model forecasts the system's evolution through solving Navier-Stokes equations with a strongly rate-dependent friction coefficient. The ensemble assimilation of data from a single location provides probabilistic estimates of fault stress and dynamic strength evolution, which capture the true solution exceptionally well. This is possible, because the sampled error covariance matrix contains prior information from the physics that relates velocities, stresses and pressure at the surface to those at the fault. In the analysis step, this covariance allows stress and strength distributions to be reconstructed. In the subsequent forecast step the physical equations are solved to propagate the updated states forward in time. This provides probabilistic information on the likelihood of occurrence of the next earthquake in this synthetic laboratory setting. Throughout the ensemble simulations the forecasting ability for large, quasi-periodic events turns out to be significantly better than that of a periodic recurrence model. For example, it only requires an alarm to sound for 17 per cent instead of 68 per cent of the time to forecast 70 per cent of 21 events. We show that combining our prior knowledge of physical laws with observations through a Bayesian framework provides distinct added value with respect to using observations or numerical models independently. This educational test thus shows vast potential for including physics-based information into probabilistic seismic hazard assessment using EDA. To analyze its real world potential assumptions on an exact representation of the physics in a 2-D simplified system remain to be explored.},

(2014) Next Generation Attenuation‐West2 (NGA‐West2) project GMPEs. NGA‐West2 addressed several key issues concerning GMPEs for shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regions. However, the NGA‐West2 results do not include many earthquakes in extensional regimes such as those occurring in Saudi Arabia. This deficiency is corrected by calculating a magnitude scaling of the new Saudi Arabia GMPEs compared to those of Boore et al. (2014). Furthermore, there is a clear difference in distance scaling for the Arabian GMPEs in comparison with the NGA‐West2 GMPEs. This difference is especially significant at large distances and is mainly due to lower anelastic attenuation in the crystalline crust of western Saudi Arabia. Our empirical data demonstrate the GMPEs presented here are in good agreement with observed earthquake ground motions in western Saudi Arabia.},

abstract = {Extreme sea levels are a significant threat to life, property, and the environment. These threats are managed by coastal planers through the implementation of risk mitigation strategies. Central to such strategies is knowledge of extreme event probabilities. Typically, these probabilities are estimated by fitting a suitable distribution to the observed extreme data. Estimates, however, are often uncertain due to the small number of extreme events in the tide gauge record and are only available at gauged locations. This restricts our ability to implement cost-effective mitigation. A remarkable fact about sea-level extremes is the existence of spatial dependences, yet the vast majority of studies to date have analyzed extremes on a site-by-site basis. Here we demonstrate that spatial dependences can be exploited to address the limitations posed by the spatiotemporal sparseness of the observational record. We achieve this by pooling all of the tide gauge data together through a Bayesian hierarchical model that describes how the distribution of surge extremes varies in time and space. Our approach has two highly desirable advantages: 1) it enables sharing of information across data sites, with a consequent drastic reduction in estimation uncertainty; 2) it permits interpolation of both the extreme values and the extreme distribution parameters at any arbitrary ungauged location. Using our model, we produce an observation-based probabilistic reanalysis of surge extremes covering the entire Atlantic and North Sea coasts of Europe for the period 1960–2013.},

A novel two-step maximum-likelihood method is used as a regression tool to develop this model. This method simultaneously considers both the correlation between records and the biased sampling because of random truncation. Moreover, additional ground-motion data can be considered to derive more reliable analysis results. The functional form of the proposed ground-motion model is constructed using the response spectrum of the reference ground-motion scenario and different scalings of the source, path, and site to illustrate the ground-motion characteristics. The variabilities in the ground-motion intensity that result from different events, stations, and records are developed individually to derive a single-station sigma. The proposed ground-motion model may be useful for predicting ground-motion intensity and performing site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in Taiwan.},

This method makes use of the Flinn--Engdahl regionalization scheme, seismotectonic information (plate boundaries, global geology, seismicity catalogs, and regional and local studies), and the source parameters available from the USGS National Earthquake Information Center in the minutes following an earthquake to give the best estimation of the setting and mechanism of the event. Depending on the tectonic setting, additional criteria based on hypocentral depth, style of faulting, and regional seismicity may be applied. For subduction zones, these criteria include the use of focal mechanism information and detailed interface models to discriminate among outer‐rise, upper‐plate, interface, and intraslab seismicity. The scheme is validated against a large database of recent historical earthquakes. Though developed to assess GMPE selection in Global ShakeMap operations, we anticipate a variety of uses for this strategy, from real‐time processing systems to any analysis involving tectonic classification of sources from seismic catalogs.Online Material: Tables and figures summarizing the proposed discrimination scheme and its performance.},

The second is that the engineer work should be integrated into the architecture historical methodology. Almost 30 years later this contribution investigate to which extent these two recommendations have been fulfilled, whether there is a common understanding between the conservation and the seismic engineering community and whether lessons from past failures are informing new strengthening strategies. 15.1},

It is thus crucial that avalanche risk assessments are based on a consistent and proper assessment of the uncertainties involved in the modelling of the avalanche run-out zones and the estimations of the damage potential. We link a Bayesian network (BN) to a Geographic Information System (GIS) for avalanche risk assessment in order to facilitate the explicit modelling of all relevant parameters, their causal relations and the involved uncertainties in a spatially explicit manner. The suggested procedure is illustrated for a case study area (Davos, Switzerland) located in the Swiss Alps. We discuss the potential of such a model by comparing the risks estimated using the probabilistic framework to those obtained by a traditional risk assessment procedure. The presented model may serve as a basis for developing a consistent and unified risk assessment approach.},

abstract = {Latent Gaussian models are a popular class of hierarchical models with applications in many fields. Performing Bayesian inference on such models can be challenging. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms struggle with the geometry of the resulting posterior distribution and can be prohibitively slow. An alternative is to use an integrated nested Laplace approximation, whereby we marginalize out the latent Gaussian variables and estimate the hyperparameters with a deterministic scheme. This type of inference typically only works for low dimensional and unimodal hyperparameters. We bypass these limitations by coupling dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with an embedded Laplace approximation. Our implementation features a novel adjoint method to differentiate the marginal likelihood, which scales with high dimensional hyperparameters. We prototype the method in the probabilistic programming framework Stan and test the utility of the embedded Laplace approximation on several models: a classic Gaussian process, a general linear regression model with a sparsity inducing horseshoe prior, and a sparse kernel interaction model. The last two models are characterized by a high dimensional and a multimodal posterior distribution of the hyperparameters, and as such present novel applications of the embedded Laplace approximation. Depending on the cases, the benefits are either a dramatic speed-up, or an alleviation of the geometric pathologies that frustrate Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.},

abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs. Code to replicate each experiment in this paper is available at github.com/sparseMCMC.},

abstract = {An essential component of seismic hazard analysis is the prediction of ground shaking (and its uncertainty), using ground-motion models (GMMs). This article proposes a new method to evaluate (i.e., rank) the suitability of GMMs for modeling ground motions in a given region. The method leverages a statistical tool from sensitivity analysis to quantitatively compare predictions of a GMM with underlying observations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method relative to several other popular GMM ranking procedures and highlight its advantages, which include its intuitive scoring system and its ability to account for the hierarchical structure of GMMs. We use the proposed method to evaluate the applicability of several GMMs for modeling ground motions from induced earthquakes due to U.K. shale gas development. The data consist of 195 recordings at hypocentral distances (R) less than 10 km for 29 events with local magnitude (ML) greater than 0 that relate to 2018/2019 hydraulic-fracture operations at the Preston New Road shale gas site in Lancashire and 192 R{\textless}10 km recordings for 48 ML{\textgreater}0 events induced—within the same geologic formation—by coal mining near New Ollerton, North Nottinghamshire. We examine: (1) the Akkar, Sandikkaya, and Bommer (2014) models for European seismicity; (2) the Douglas et al. (2013) model for geothermal-induced seismicity; and (3) the Atkinson (2015) model for central and eastern North America induced seismicity. We find the Douglas et al. (2013) model to be the most suitable for almost all of the considered ground-motion intensity measures. We modify this model by recomputing its coefficients in line with the observed data, to further improve its accuracy for future analyses of the seismic hazard of interest. This study both advances the state of the art in GMM evaluation and enhances understanding of the seismic hazard related to U.K. shale gas development.},

Geographically representing each earthquake with its corresponding attenuation tendency, it can be seen that those with low attenuation lie west of the Peninsula and those with high attenuation in the south and east. This regionalization seems to be due as much to the seismotectonic characteristics (different crustal types and size of the earthquakes) as to the different construction types in each region. These attenuation values are similar to those of southern Europe, but much higher than those found in the United States. From the point of view of seismic-hazard evaluation, these laws represent an improvement with regard to those used so far. We have extended previous attenuation studies to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, and, in some points, differences of attenuation assignment of almost two degrees of intensity have been corrected.},

In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

abstract = {Strong ground motion close to a fault can be expected to be very large, so its estimation is essential for human safety. Although a few strong-motion data exist for the west Eurasian region, we proposed in a previous work [Berge-Thierry et al., 2003] an attenuation relation for spectral acceleration using strong-motion data recorded in west Eurasia (mainly in Europe) and some in the western United States: this relationship was derived for the French Safety Rule, which is applied for seismic hazard assessment at nuclear power plants. In this study, we propose a constraining of the amplitude saturation term related to the proximity of the fault, and an adding of an amplitude saturation term in the regression model. We add, to the data-set previously used to derive the west Eurasian attenuation relationship strong-motions recorded during recent large earthquakes: the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu (Kobe) event in Japan and the 1999 Kocaeli (Izmit) event in Turkey. The regression analysis, adopted from Pukushima and Tanaka [1990], is non-linear, so an iterative procedure is applied. The determined regression coefficients lead to a prediction of a peak ground acceleration of about 0.7g for soil site conditions at a fault distance of 0.5 km. The Q coefficient deduced from the distance coefficient is in agreement with scattering Q models. The introduction of the saturation term leads to significantly lower predictions of average spectral accelerations at short distances as compared with using the Berge-Thierry et al. [2003] empirical model.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a nonparametric multivariate spatial model that avoids specifying a Gaussian distribution for spatial random effects. Our nonparametric model extends the stick-breaking (SB) prior of Sethuraman (1994), which is frequently used in Bayesian modelling to capture uncertainty in the parametric form of an outcome. The stick-breaking prior is extended here to the spatial setting by assigning each location a different, unknown distribution, and smoothing the distributions in space with a series of space-dependent kernel functions that have a space-varying bandwidth parameter. This results in a flexible non-stationary spatial model, as different kernel functions lead to different relationships between the distributions at nearby locations. This approach is the first to allow both the probabilities and the point mass values of the SB prior to depend on space. Thus, there is no need for replications and we obtain a continuous process in the limit. We extend the model to the multivariate setting by having for each process a different kernel function, but sharing the location of the kernel knots across the different processes. The resulting covariance for the multivariate process is in general nonstationary and nonseparable. The modelling framework proposed here is also computationally efficient because it avoids inverting large matrices and calculating determinants, which often hinders the spatial analysis of large data sets. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed multivariate spatial process. The methods are illustrated using simulated examples and an air pollution application to model components of fine particulate matter.},

abstract = {Seismic shear-wave velocity as a function of depth for generic rock sites has been estimated from borehole data and studies of crustal velocities, and these velocities have been used to compute frequency-dependent amplifications for zero attenuation for use in simulations of strong ground motion. We define a generic rock site as one whose velocity at shallow depths equals the average of those from the rock sites sampled by the borehole data. Most of the boreholes are in populated areas; for that reason, the rock sites sampled are of particular engineering significance. We consider two generic rock sites: rock, corresponding to the bulk of the borehole data, and very hard rock, such as is found in glaciated regions in large areas of eastern North America or in portions of western North America. The amplifications on rock sites can be in excess of 3.5 at high frequencies, in contrast to the amplifications of less than 1.2 on very hard rock sites. The consideration of unattenuated amplification alone is computationally convenient, but what matters for ground-motion estimation is the combined effect of amplification and attenuation. For reasonable values of the attenuation parameter $\kappa$0, the combined effect of attenuation and amplification for rock sites peaks between about 2 and 5 Hz with a maximum level of less than 1.8. The combined effect is about a factor of 1.5 at 1 Hz and is less than unity for frequencies in the range of 10 to 20 Hz (depending on $\kappa$0). Using these amplifications, we find provisional values of about $\Delta$$\sigma$ = 70 bars and $\kappa$0 = 0.035 sec for rock sites in western North America by fitting our empirically determined response spectra for an M 6.5 event to simulated values. The borehole data yield shear velocities (V̅30) of 618 and 306 m/sec for “rock” and “soil” sites, respectively, when averaged over the upper 30 m. From this, we recommend that V̅30 equals 620 and 310 m/sec for applications requiring the average velocity for rock and soil sites in western North America. By combining the amplifications for rock sites and the site factors obtained from our analysis of strong-motion data, we derive amplifications for sites with V̅30 = 520 m/sec (NEHRP class C, corresponding to a mix of rock and soil sites) and V̅30 = 310 and 255 m/sec (average soil and NEHRP class D sites, respectively). For the average soil site, the combined effect of amplification and attenuation exceeds a factor of 2.0 for frequencies between 0.4 and about 4 Hz, with a peak site effect of 2.4; the peak of the NEHRP class D site effect is 2.7.},

abstract = {To date little is known about seismic hazard in Eritrea, despite its location in a volcanically and tectonically active region, and the gathering pace of major infrastructure projects. In response, we report the findings of a comprehensive probabilistic seismic-hazard assessment for Eritrea and adjacent areas. Seismic source and groundmotion models are constructed separately; we use an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing method to map expected patterns of seismicity. To construct a consistent earthquake catalog from different data sets, we use orthogonal regression to convert and unify different magnitude scales. A sensitivity analysis of the different input parameters helps constrain them and disaggregation of site-specific hazard estimates yields insights into the relative contribution from seismic sources of different magnitudes and distances. The results highlight seismic hazard in proximity to the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Afar depression, and along the boundaries of the Danakil microplate. We estimate a 10{\%} chance over 50 years of observing pseudospectral accelerations (PSAs) at 0.2 s exceeding 0:16g in the port city of Massawa (population ∼32;000) and the town of Bada (population ∼4000). For the capital, Asmara (population ∼520;000), we calculate a PSA of 0:11g at 0.2 s. Compared with previous studies, our results provide greater spatial resolution, use more recent ground-motion models, and benefit from a smoothed seismicity method. Our aims are to stimulate further studies and contribute to the safe development of the region in light of its exposure to seismic hazards.},

abstract = {This paper addresses model dimensionality reduction for Bayesian inference based on prior Gaussian fields with uncertainty in the covariance function hyper-parameters. The dimensionality reduction is traditionally achieved using the Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve expansion of a prior Gaussian process assuming covariance function with fixed hyper-parameters, despite the fact that these are uncertain in nature. The posterior distribution of the Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve coordinates is then inferred using available observations. The resulting inferred field is therefore dependent on the assumed hyper-parameters. Here, we seek to efficiently estimate both the field and covariance hyper-parameters using Bayesian inference. To this end, a generalized Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve expansion is derived using a coordinate transformation to account for the dependence with respect to the covariance hyper-parameters. Polynomial Chaos expansions are employed for the acceleration of the Bayesian inference using similar coordinate transformations, enabling us to avoid expanding explicitly the solution dependence on the uncertain hyper-parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method on a transient diffusion equation by inferring spatially-varying log-diffusivity fields from noisy data. The inferred profiles were found closer to the true profiles when including the hyper-parameters' uncertainty in the inference formulation.},

abstract = {The effects of near-surface soil stratigraphy on the amplitude and frequency content of ground motion are accounted for in most modern U.S. seismic design codes for building structures as a function of the soil conditions prevailing in the area of interest. Nonetheless, currently employed site-classification criteria do not adequately describe the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil formations, which prohibits the development of standardized procedures for the computationally efficient integration of nonlinear ground response analyses in broadband ground-motion simulations. In turn, the lack of a unified methodology for nonlinear site-response analyses affects both the prediction accuracy of site-specific ground-motion intensity measures and the evaluation of site-amplification factors when broadband simulations are used for the development of hybrid attenuation relations. In this article, we introduce a set of criteria for quantification of the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil profiles based on the site conditions and incident ground-motion characteristics, and we implement them to identify the least complex ground response prediction methodology required for the simulation of nonlinear site effects at three sites in the Los Angeles basin. The criteria are developed on the basis of a comprehensive nonlinear site-response modeling uncertainty analysis, which includes both detailed soil profile descriptions and statistical adequacy of ground-motion time histories. Approximate and incremental nonlinear models are implemented, and the limited site-response observations are initially compared to the ensemble site-response estimates. A suite of synthetic ground motions for rupture scenarios of weak, medium, and large magnitude events (M 3.5-7.5) is next generated, parametric studies are conducted for each fixed magnitude scenario by varying the source-to-site distance, and the variability introduced in ground-motion predictions is quantified for each nonlinear site-response methodology. A frequency index is developed to describe the frequency content of incident ground motion relative to the resonant frequencies of the soil profile, and this index is used in conjunction with the rock-outcrop acceleration peak amplitude (PGARO) to identify the site conditions and ground-motion characteristics where incremental nonlinear analyses should be employed in lieu of approximate methodologies. We show that the proposed intensity-frequency representation of ground motion may be implemented to describe the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil formations in broadband simulations by accounting both for the magnitude-distance-orientation characteristics of seismic motion and the profile stiffness characteristics. The synthetic ground-motion predictions are next used for the development of site-amplification factors for the alternative site-response methodologies, and the results are compared to published site factors of attenuation relations. For the site conditions investigated, currently established amplification factors compare well with synthetic simulations for class C and D site conditions, while long-period amplification factors are overestimated by a factor of 1.5 at the class E site, where site-specific nonlinear analyses should be employed for levels of PGARO{\textgreater}0.2g.

abstract = {A geometrical ray method is developed for wave calculations involving three- dimensional planar dipping interfaces. Justification for the method is based on analogy with first-motion approximations derived from generalized ray theory where frequency dependence in the reflection-transmission coefficients is related to changes in the complex ray parameter. The method is applied to finding the teleseismic response of an arbitrarily oriented dislocation source in dipping layered media and for receiver calculations which assume an impinging P or S wave be- neath a stack of dipping layers. Source results indicate that wave forms from fast azimuthally varying sources, such as strike-slip faults, are significantly dis- torted from the plane layered case for simple structures. A simple dipping Moho for dips up to 10 ° does not significantly distort vertical and radial P waves for the receiver response. However, due to azimuth anomalies introduced by inter- face dip a significant tangential P component is produced. In addition, the S-wave response becomes a function of source mechanism due to the need for specifying the incident polarization angle. Polarization studies are suggested for finding dipping structure. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {The K-means algorithm is one of the most popular clustering algorithms in current use as it is relatively fast yet simple to understand and deploy in practice. Nevertheless, its use entails certain restrictive assumptions about the data, the negative consequences of which are not always immediately apparent, as we demonstrate. While more flexible algorithms have been developed, their widespread use has been hindered by their computational and technical complexity. Motivated by these considerations, we present a flexible alternative to K-means that relaxes most of the assumptions, whilst remaining almost as fast and simple. This novel algorithm which we call MAP-DP (maximum a-posteriori Dirichlet process mixtures), is statistically rigorous as it is based on nonparametric Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture modeling. This approach allows us to overcome most of the limitations imposed by K-means. The number of clusters K is estimated from the data instead of being fixed a-priori as in K-means. In addition, while K-means is restricted to continuous data, the MAP-DP framework can be applied to many kinds of data, for example, binary, count or ordinal data. Also, it can efficiently separate outliers from the data. This additional flexibility does not incur a significant computational overhead compared to K-means with MAP-DP convergence typically achieved in the order of seconds for many practical problems. Finally, in contrast to K-means, since the algorithm is based on an underlying statistical model, the MAP-DP framework can deal with missing data and enables model testing such as cross validation in a principled way. We demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of this algorithm on the health informatics problem of clinical sub-typing in a cluster of diseases known as parkinsonism.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The automation of posterior inference in Bayesian data analysis has enabled experts and nonexperts alike to use more sophisticated models, engage in faster exploratory modeling and analysis, and ensure experimental reproducibility. However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at the scale of massive modern datasets, and modifications to make them so are typically model-specific, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework, this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the dataset itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic datasets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a significant reduction in the computational cost of inference.},

Although there is inevitably considerable uncertainty associated with the assessment of seismic hazard in such a region, those studies indicating rather high levels of ground motion associated with a 475-year return period are found to be the result of inappropriate seismic source zonations that spread seismicity from the Zagros region of Iran into the Arabian Peninsula. A new probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is performed within a logic-tree framework, and the results displayed as uniform hazard spectra for rock sites in the cities of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Ra's Al Khaymah in the UAE. The results support the UBC 1997 classification of the two former cities in Zone 0 (no seismic design required) whereas in Ra's Al Khaymah Zone 1 would be appropriate.},

abstract = {In many applications, the objective is to build regression models to explain a response variable over a region of interest under the assumption that the responses are spatially correlated. In nearly all of this work, the regression coefficients are assumed to be constant over the region. However, in some applications, coefficients are expected to vary at the local or subregional level. Here we focus on the local case. Although parametric modeling of the spatial surface for the coefficient is possible, here we argue that it is more natural and flexible to view the surface as a realization from a spatial process. We show how such modeling can be formalized in the context of Gaussian responses providing attractive interpretation in terms of both random effects and explaining residuals. We also offer extensions to generalized linear models and to spatio-temporal setting. We illustrate both static and dynamic modeling with a dataset that attempts to explain (log) selling price of single-family houses. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2003 American Statistical Association},

This region-specific model yields consistently higher correlation values compared with similar studies developed for shallow crustal regions and other subduction zones worldwide, particularly for pseudo-acceleration values at distant periods.

abstract = {Source parameters for historical earthquakes worldwide are com- piled to develop a series of empirical relationships among moment magnitude (M), surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, rupture area, and maximum and average displacement per event. The resulting data base is a significant update of previous compilations and includes the ad- ditional source parameters of seismic moment, moment magnitude, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, and average surface displacement. Each source parameter is classified as reliable or unreliable, based on our evaluation of the accuracy of individual values. Only the reliable source parameters are used in the final analyses. In comparing source parameters, we note the fol- lowing trends: (1) Generally, the length of rupture at the surface is equal to 75{\%} of the subsurface rupture length; however, the ratio of surface rupture length to subsurface rupture length increases with magnitude; (2) the average surface dis- placement per event is about one-half the maximum surface displacement per event; and (3) the average subsurface displacement on the fault plane is less than the maximum surface displacement but more than the average surface dis- placement. Thus, for most earthquakes in this data base, slip on the fault plane at seismogenic depths is manifested by similar displacements at the surface. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area are especially well correlated, show- ing standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units. Most relationships are not statistically different (at a 95{\%} significance level) as a function of the style of faulting: thus, we consider the regressions for all slip types to be appropriate for most applications. Regressions between magnitude and displacement, mag- nitude and rupture width, and between displacement and rupture length are less well correlated and have larger standard deviation than regressions between magnitude and length or area. The large number of data points in most of these regressions and their statistical stability suggest that they are unlikely to change significantly in response to additional data. Separating the data according to extensional and compressional tectonic environments neither provides statisti- cally different results nor improves the statistical significance of the regressions. Regressions for cases in which earthquake magnitude is either the independent or the dependent parameter can be used to estimate maximum earthquake mag- nitudes both for surface faults and for subsurface seismic sources such as blind faults, and to estimate the expected surface displacement along a fault for a given size earthquake.},

If spatial correlation is suspected in a data set of earthquakes in a particular geographic area, the smoothing parameter needed to obtain the estimator of the mean magnitude will be computed using a corrected version of a generalized cross-validation method. This procedure allows us to take the spatial dependence into account to obtain better smoothing parameters. Additionally, a parametric bootstrap technique is used to quantify the variability of the spatial maps produced with the nonparametric estimation method and to compute the probability of observing a magnitude larger than or equal to a given threshold for an earthquake occurring in a specific epicenter. These techniques are applied to two different earthquake data sets: the historic catalog of the northwest Iberian Peninsula and the earthquakes in California from January 1998 to April 2008.},

Unprocessed strong motion records are obtained from the Iranian Strong Motion Network (ISMN). The time series collected were thoroughly examined through several rounds of quality reviews. The newly generated database includes the peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and pseudo-spectral acceleration for the 5{\%} damped with periods ranging from 0.01 to 10 s.

abstract = {A proper assessment of seismic reference site conditions has important applications as they represent the basis on which ground motions and amplifications are generally computed. Besides accounting for the average S‐wave velocity over the uppermost 30 m (VS30), the parameterization of high‐frequency ground motions beyond source‐corner frequency received significant attention. $\kappa$, an empirical parameter introduced by Anderson and Hough (1984), is often used to represent the spectral decay of the acceleration spectrum at high frequencies. The lack of hard‐rock records and the poor understanding of the physics of $\kappa$ introduced significant epistemic uncertainty in the final seismic hazard of recent projects. Thus, determining precise and accurate regional hard‐rock $\kappa$0 values is critical. We propose an alternative procedure for capturing the reference $\kappa$0 on regional scales by linking the well‐known high‐frequency attenuation parameter $\kappa$ and the properties of multiple‐scattered coda waves. Using geological and geophysical data around more than 1300 stations for separating reference and soft soil sites and based on more than 10,000 crustal earthquake recordings, we observe that $\kappa$0 from multiple‐scattered coda waves seems to be independent of the soil type but correlated with the hard‐rock $\kappa$0, showing significant regional variations across Europe. The values range between 0.004 s for northern Europe and 0.020 s for the southern and southeastern parts. On the other hand, measuring $\kappa$ (and correspondingly $\kappa$0) on the S‐wave window (as classically proposed), the results are strongly affected by transmitted (reflected, refracted, and scattered) waves included in the analyzed window biasing the proper assessment of $\kappa$0. This effect is more pronounced for soft soil sites. In this way, $\kappa$0coda can serve as a proxy for the regional hard‐rock $\kappa$0 at the reference sites.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Seismological Society of America. All rights reserved. We present ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for vertical response spectra from Mexican interplate earthquakes at rock sites (National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program B class). Two options to obtain the vertical response spectrum are presented: (1) directly from the vertical-attenuation model and (2) by multiplying the horizontal spectral ordinates by the vertical-to-horizontal ratios. The equations were built as functions of magnitude and distance to the fault surface of the earthquake, using 40 interplate earthquakes. We compared our results with previous attenuation models for inslab and interplate earthquakes in Mexico, and other vertical-attenuation models in the world. The predicted intensities from the model were found to be in broad agreement with models derived with other models worldwide. Not many vertical and/or vertical-to-horizontal attenuation models were found in the literature, although the vertical response of structures is used in practice and included in design codes. Nevertheless, it seems to be a trend to pay more attention to this model. There was also found to be a lack of GMPEs for vertical response spectra applicable to subduction interplate earthquakes for a large range of distances and the region under study. Therefore, an attenuation model for interplate earthquakes was developed for distances up to around 400 km and Mw from {\~{}}5 to 8. The model could be useful for probabilistic seismic-hazard assessment and as an aid for code writers.},

First part of this paper uses available data of strong motion earthquakes recorded in this region between 2006 and 2008 years to prepare attenuation relation. The developed attenuation relation is further used to prepare synthetic strong motion records of large magnitude earthquakes using semiempirical simulation technique. Semiempirical simulation technique uses attenuation relation to simulate strong ground motion records of any target earthquake. The database of peak ground acceleration obtained from simulated records is used together with database of peak ground acceleration obtained from observed record to develop following hybrid attenuation model of wide applicability in the Kutch region:, In the above equation, PGA is maximum horizontal ground acceleration in gal, Mw is moment magnitude of earthquake, R is hypocentral distance, and E is epicentral distance in km. The standard deviation of residual of error in this relation is 0.5. This relation is compared with other available relations in this region, and it is seen that developed relation gives minimum root mean square error in comparison with observed and calculated peak ground acceleration from same data set. The applicability of developed relation is further checked by testing it with the observed peak ground acceleration from earthquakes of magnitude (Mw), 3.6, 4.0, 4.4, and 7.7, respectively, which are not included in the database used for regression analysis. The comparison demonstrates the efficacy of developed hybrid attenuation model for calculating peak ground acceleration values in the Kutch region. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

We present a fully Bayesian approach to this problem. Our model is capable of simultaneously solving the data association problem and the induced supervised learning problem. Underpinning our approach is the use of Gaussian process priors to encode the structure of both the data and the data associations. We present an efficient learning scheme based on doubly stochastic variational inference and discuss how it can be applied to deep Gaussian process priors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Seismological Society of America. All rights reserved. Probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis (PSHA) is the current tool of the trade used to estimate the future seismic demands at a site of interest. A modern PSHA represents a complex framework that combines different models with numerous inputs. It is important to understand and assess the impact of these inputs on the model output in a quantitative way. Sensitivity analysis is a valuable tool for quantifying changes of a model output as inputs are perturbed, identifying critical input parameters, and obtaining insight about the model behavior. Differential sensitivity analysis relies on calculating first-order partial derivatives of the model output with respect to its inputs; however, obtaining the derivatives of complex models can be challenging. In this study, we show how differential sensitivity analysis of a complex framework such as PSHA can be carried out using algorithmic/automatic differentiation (AD). AD has already been successfully applied for sensitivity analyses in various domains such as oceanography and aerodynamics. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of the AD methodology by comparing AD-derived sensitivities with analytically derived sensitivities for a basic case of PSHA using a simple ground-motion prediction equation. Second, we derive sensitivities via AD for a more complex PSHA study using a stochastic simulation approach for the prediction of ground motions. The presented approach is general enough to accommodate more advanced PSHA studies of greater complexity.},

@article{Ray2019,
abstract = {A key aspect of geophysical inversion is the ability to model the earth with a low dimensional representation. There exist various approaches to solve the inverse problem. However, most methods do not automatically adapt inverse model complexity or the number of active model parameters as dictated by data noise and sparse receiver coverage, do not quantify inverse model uncertainty or do not work equally well for 1-D, 2-D or 3-D earth models. Low-frequency electromagnetic (EM) inversion, for example, can require for 3-D problems upwards of 106 cells to forward model. Only a small fraction of these cells are effectively resolvable and there are significant trade-offs between them. To address such problems and get around these limitations we present a novel approach to earth model parametrization by using a Gaussian Processes (GP) machine learning (ML) technique, coupled with a parsimonious Bayesian trans-dimensional (trans-D) Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme. One aspect that sets our approach apart from recent spatial dimension agnostic algorithms in the trans-D or ML literature is the ability to specify inversion property priors directly, as opposed to doing so in a transform domain of the property. We develop the theory, describe the effects of specifying different geological priors and apply the trans-D-GP method to a 1-D controlled source EM and 2-D nonlinear regression problem, using actual field data from the Northwest Australian Shelf for the former. The key advantages in using our method are the simplicity of prior specification, parsimonious low dimensional representations and ease of representing large-scale models in 1-D, 2-D or even 3-D with the same parametrization and computer code.},

abstract = {This paper presents ground motion models to predict vertical components of peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and 5{\%}-damped response spectral acceleration at periods ranging from 0.01 to 10 s. These models are derived from the comprehensive Iranian strong ground-motion database containing 1350 three-component time-histories recorded during 370 earthquakes with 4.5 ≤ M w ≤ 7.4. Possible regional dependency of vertical ground-motions to characteristics of three seismo-tectonic regions in Iran was investigated through analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. Consistent models based on four distance measures; two for point-source (R epi and R hyp) and two for finite-fault (R JB and R rup), were developed. The distribution of inter and intra-event residuals presents satisfactory agreement between actual data and our proposed vertical ground motion prediction equation (GMPE). Furthermore, a detailed comparison between our predictions and four local and global GMPEs is presented, well as horizontal model of Darzi et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am. https://doi.org/10.1785/0120180196, 2018). In addition, this study provides period-dependent correlation coefficients between epsilons of different GMPEs corresponds to either horizontal, vertical, or vertical-to-horizontal spectral ratio intensity measures as a function of single or two-periods of interest.},

abstract = {A probabilistic seismic hazard assessment is developed here using maximum credible earthquake magnitude statistics and earthquake perceptibility hazard. Earthquake perceptibility hazard is defined as the probability a site perceives ground shaking equal to or greater than a selected ground motion level X, resulting from an earthquake of magnitude M, and develops estimates for the most perceptible earthquake magnitude, MP(max). Realistic and usable maximum magnitude statistics are obtained from both whole process and part process statistical recurrence models. These approaches are extended to develop relationships between perceptible earthquake magnitude hazard and maximum magnitude recurrence models that are governed by asymptotic and finite return period properties, respectively. Integrated perceptibility curves illustrating the probability of a specific level of perceptible ground motion due to all earthquakes over the magnitude range extending from -∞ to a magnitude Mi are then developed from reviewing site-specific magnitude perceptibility. These lead on to achieving site-specific annual probability of exceedance hazard curves for the example cities of Sofia and Thessaloniki for both horizontal ground acceleration and ground velocity. Both the maximum credible earthquake magnitude M3 and the most perceptible earthquake magnitude MP(max) are of importance to the earthquake engineer when approaching anti-seismic building design. Both forms of hazard are illustrated using contoured hazard maps for the region bounded by 39°-45°N, 19°-29°E. Patterns are observed for these magnitude hazard estimates-especially MP(max) specific to horizontal ground acceleration and horizontal ground velocity-and compared to inferred patterns of crustal deformation across the region. The full geographic region considered is estimated to be subject to a maximum credible earthquake magnitude M3-estimated using cumulative seismic moment release statistics-of 7.53 Mw, calculated from the full content of the adopted earthquake catalogue, while Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, is estimated a comparable value of 7.36 Mw. Sofia is also forecast most perceptible earthquake magnitudes for the lowest levels considered for horizontal ground acceleration of MPA(50) = 7.20 Mw and horizontal ground velocity of MPV(5) = 7.23 Mw for a specimen focal depth of 15 km. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Earthquake source spectra contain fundamental information about the dynamics of earthquake rupture. However, the inherent tradeoffs in separating source and path effects, when combined with limitations in recorded signal bandwidth, make it challenging to obtain reliable source spectral estimates for large earthquake data sets. We present here a stable and statistically robust spectral decomposition method that iteratively partitions the observed waveform spectra into source, receiver, and path terms. Unlike previous methods of its kind, our new approach provides formal uncertainty estimates and does not assume self-similar scaling in earthquake source properties. Its computational efficiency allows us to examine large data sets (tens of thousands of earthquakes) that would be impractical to analyze using standard empirical Green's function-based approaches. We apply the spectral decomposition technique to P wave spectra from five areas of active contemporary seismicity in Southern California: the Yuha Desert, the San Jacinto Fault, and the Big Bear, Landers, and Hector Mine regions of the Mojave Desert. We show that the source spectra are generally consistent with an increase in median Brune-type stress drop with seismic moment but that this observed deviation from self-similar scaling is both model dependent and varies in strength from region to region. We also present evidence for significant variations in median stress drop and stress drop variability on regional and local length scales. These results both contribute to our current understanding of earthquake source physics and have practical implications for the next generation of ground motion prediction assessments.},

abstract = {Peninsular India (10.0{\{}degrees{\}} N-28.0{\{}degrees{\}} N; 68.0{\{}degrees{\}} E-90.0{\{}degrees{\}} E) is one of the oldest and seismically most stable landmasses of the Indian plate. Recent seismic history, however, shows that more than five damaging earthquakes with magnitudes greater than Mw 6.0 have occurred in this region, highlighting the importance of seismic- hazard assessment for the region. This article estimates the probabilistic seismic hazard associated with peninsular India with a zoneless approach incorporating the observed seismic activity and known geological characteristics of the region. The seismicity parameters for hazard assessment have been estimated incorporating completeness criteria for various spans of the catalog data. The spatial and temporal variations of seismic activity have been modeled using different source models. Seismic source zones for the region have been defined on the basis of large-scale geological features, which are used for assigning the maximum possible earthquake potential. Due to the poorly known attenuation characteristics of the study region, three appropriate attenuation models have been used for the estimation of ground- motion parameters. Hazard maps for peninsular India have been developed using a convolution scheme based on weighting and incorporating various uncertainties involved while modeling different parameters. The comparison of the probabilistic seismic-hazard map developed herein with the hazard map specified in the Indian Standards shows that the design parameters in the Indian Standards may significantly underestimate the seismic hazard in some regions of peninsular India.

An integrated strong motion dataset consisting of two subduction earthquake regions was selected from 3314 recordings from Taiwan with M4.5 to M7.1 and 3376 recordings from Japan with M6.5 to M9.1. This dataset was then used to validate, and refit where necessary, the function form provided by Abrahamson et al. for application to Taiwan subduction earthquakes. The proposed model accounts for the extrapolation behaviors associated with the large-magnitude scaling and the near-source scaling terms, both of which were developed empirically by using the combined Taiwan–Japan dataset. The distance attenuation and site term were developed specifically for the Taiwan region. The site term is based on two parameters; the time-averaged shear wave velocity of the top 30 m depth ( V S 30 ) and the depth-to-the-shear wave velocity horizon of 1.0 km/s ( Z 1.0 ).},

Instead, all the GPs in the mixture are global and samples are clustered following trajectories across input space.

A Bayesian interpretation based on a spike-and-slab model makes little sense in applied contexts in epidemiology, political science, and other fields in which true effects are typically nonzero and bounded (thus violating both the “spike” and the “slab” parts of the model).},

abstract = {We consider a problem of inference for the output of a computationally expensive computer model. We suppose that the model is to be used in a context where the values of one or more inputs are uncertain, so that the input configuration is a random variable. We require to make inference about the induced distribution of the output. This distri-bution is called the uncertainty distribution, and the general problem is known to users of computer models as uncertainty analysis. To be specific, we develop Bayesian inference for the distribution and density functions of the model output. Modelling the output, as a function of its inputs, as a Gaussian process, we derive expressions for the posterior mean and variance of the distribution and density functions, based on data comprising observed outputs at a sample of input configurations. We show that direct computation of these expressions may encounter numerical difficulties. We develop an alternative approach based on simulating approximate realisations from the posterior distribution of the output function. Two examples are given to illustrate our methods. 1. U  We consider a deterministic complex computer model which computes an output y from input x. Since x will typically be a vector we refer to it as the input configuration, and to individual elements of x as inputs. The output y will be a scalar, typically one element of an output vector. We formally represent y as a function of x, y=g(x). A common scenario is that the values of one or more inputs are uncertain, typically because it is impracticable to measure the input. We therefore consider X, the 'true' input configur-ation, to be a random variable with distribution G(x). Consequently the output Y =g(X) is a random variable, and it is the distribution of Y, known as the uncertainty distribution, that is of interest. If the model can be run at a large number of distinct input configurations with little computational effort, then the problem of uncertainty analysis has a straightforward solu-tion. We first draw a large sample of random input configurations from the input distri-bution G(x), and then evaluate the output of the computer model at each sampled input configuration to obtain a random sample of outputs. From this Monte Carlo sample one can then make the required inferences for the uncertainty distribution. In this paper we are interested in the case where the computer model is computationally expensive, to the extent that the Monte Carlo approach is not practicable. This is because the sample of},

abstract = {Estimation of the covariance structure of spatial processes is a fundamental prerequisite for problems of spatial interpolation and the design of monitoring networks. We introduce a nonparametric approach to global estimation of the spatial covariance structure of a random function Z(x, t) observed repeatedly at times ti (i = 1, ⋯, T) at a finite number of sampling stations xi (i = 1, 2, ..., N) in the plane. Our analyses assume temporal stationarity but do not assume spatial stationarity (or isotropy). We analyze the spatial dispersions {\$}\backslashoperatorname{\{}var{\}}(Z(x{\_}i, t) - Z(x{\_}j, t)){\$} as a natural metric for the spatial covariance structure and model these as a general smooth function of the geographic coordinate of station pairs (xi, xj). The model is constructed in two steps. First, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) we compute a two-dimensional representation of the sampling stations for which a monotone function of interpoint distances $\delta$ij approximates the spatial dispersions. MDS transforms the problem into one for which the covariance structure, expressed in terms of spatial dispersions, is stationary and isotropic. Second, we compute thinplate splines to provide smooth mappings of the geographic representation of the sampling stations into their MDS representation. The composition of this mapping f and a monotone function g derived from MDS yields a nonparametric estimator of {\$}\backslashoperatorname{\{}var{\}}(Z(x{\_}a, t) - Z(x{\_}b, t)){\$} for any two geographic locations xa and xb (monitored or not) of the form g(∣ f(xa) - f(xb(∣). By restricting the monotone function g to a class of conditionally nonpositive definite variogram functions, we ensure that the resulting nonparametric model corresponds to a nonnegative definite covariance model. We use biorthogonal grids, introduced by Bookstein in the field of morphometrics, to depict the thin-plate spline mappings that embody the nature of the anisotropy and nonstationarity in the sample covariance matrix. An analysis of mesoscale variability in solar radiation monitored in southwestern British Columbia demonstrates this methodology.},

abstract = {Two new algorithms are presented for efficiently selecting suites of ground motions that match a target multivariate distribution or conditional intensity measure target. The first algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach in which records are sequentially added to a selected set such that the joint probability density function (PDF) of the target distribution is progressively approximated by the discrete distribution of the selected records. The second algorithm derives from the concept of the acceptance ratio within MCMC but does not involve any sampling. The first method takes advantage of MCMC's ability to efficiently explore a sampling distribution through the implementation of a traditional MCMC algorithm. This method is shown to enable very good matches to multivariate targets to be obtained when the numbers of records to be selected is relatively large. A weaker performance for fewer records can be circumvented by the second method that uses greedy optimisation to impose additional constraints upon properties of the target distribution. A preselection approach based upon values of the multivariate PDF is proposed that enables near-optimal record sets to be identified with a very close match to the target. Both methods are applied for a number response analyses associated with differ- ent sizes of record sets and rupture scenarios. Comparisons aremade throughout with theGeneralised Conditional Intensity Measure (GCIM) approach. The first method provides similar results to GCIM but with slightly worse performance for small record sets,while the second method outperforms method 1 andGCIM for all considered cases.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to derive the attenuation relationships for PGA, PGV, and EPA parameters for areas within the seismic zones of Zagros, Alborz and Central Iran with rock and soil substructures. In order to do so, at first the available scientific data including the methods used for deriving attenuation relationships and the parameters involved have been gathered. Afterwards, all the efforts have been focused on gathering a thorough catalogue of earthquakes occurred in Iran. In this regard, a majority of the available catalogs in Iran have been gathered and corrected through different methods and finally a set of 89 earthquake events including 307 earthquake records with reliable data was chosen. Since in order to derive the attenuation relationships it is essential to extract the parameters from the acceleration records, a great effort was placed on gathering the earthquake acceleration records of Iran. This resulted in building a database of a majority of the earthquake records up to the year of 2004. Afterwards, correction methods applicable to earthquakes records of Iran considering the type of machines used and the ground type were examined which resulted in certain guidelines for correction of earthquake acceleration record data related to Iran. In the next step the needed parameters were extracted from the earthquake acceleration record data which were consequently divided into two seismic zones of Zagros, and Alborz and Central Iran according to tectonic conditions. After examination of the parameters and choosing the most appropriate among them, the attenuation relationships were derived for such parameters.},

abstract = {Conventional probabilistic seismic-hazard assessment (PSHA) is difficult to apply in regions lacking sufficient information concerning geological setting, active faults, and so forth. Also, for a site-specific PSHA, site effects arising from both crustal rock and overlying soil sediments are generally not assessed rigorously. This is of particular importance for those metropolitan cities having a significant proportion of reclaimed land, because the site-to-site variability of such site effects can be very large. The objective of this article is to demonstrate an alternative procedure for assessing seismic hazard, developed from the conventional source-based Cornell-McGuire PSHA approach, based on considering an infinite number of sources. The proposed new procedure is termed the direct amplitude-based (DAB) approach. The major advantage of the proposed DAB approach is that it is not necessary to characterize any seismic sources. Moreover, if a "site-specific" and "event- specific" ground-motion attenuation model is available, a more accurate site-specific PSHA could be performed. Also, a generic analytical solution for the proposed procedure has been derived to avoid the need for a lengthy integration process. Using the proposed approach, peak ground velocities have been computed at different return periods, to form a seismic hazard curve, citing Hong Kong as a case study.

abstract = {Gamma radiation from natural sources is an important component of background radiation, and correlates with childhood leukaemia risk in Great Britain. The geographic variation of indoor gamma radiation dose-rates in Great Britain is explored using various geo-statistical methods. A multi-resolution Gaussian-process model using radial basis functions with 2, 4, or 8 components, is fitted via maximum likelihood, and a non-spatial model is also used, fitted by ordinary least squares. Because of the dataset size (N = 10,199), four other parametric spatial models are fitted by variogram-fitting. A randomly selected 70:30 split is used for fitting:validation. The models are evaluated based on their predictive performance as measured by Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, as well as Pearson correlation and rank-correlation between predicted and actual dose-rates. Each of the four parametric models (Mat{\'{e}}rn, Gaussian, Bessel, Spherical) fitted the empirical variogram well, and yielded similar predictions at {\textgreater}50 km separation, although with more substantial differences in predicted variograms at {\textless}50 km. The multi-resolution Gaussian-process model with 8 components had the best predictive accuracy among the models considered. The Spherical, Bessel, Mat{\'{e}}rn, Gaussian and ordinary least squares models had progressively worse predictive performance, the ordinary least squares model being particularly poor in this respect.},

abstract = {Macroseismic intensity has recently attracted attention as a tool for validating probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) studies or as an alternative method for PSHA in countries where the historical catalog is much longer than the instrumental one. In Italy, the new seismic hazard map was recently produced using the Cornell-McGuire approach in terms of the peak ground acceleration characterized by a 10{\%} exceedance probability for an exposure time of 50 yr (Amax). We compare this map with an alternative one, produced using a different approach based on a nonparametric and zonation-free statistical analysis of local seismic histories. In this case, results are expressed in terms of the maximum intensity corresponding to an exceedance probability of not less than 10{\%} for an exposure time of 50 yr (Iref). In order to compare the two maps, we selected 1401 control sites, where local seismic history includes at least 10 intensity values relative to felt effects documented during past earthquakes. The values of Amax and Iref at these sites have been ranked in the respective domains. The spatial distribution of rank differences of Amax and Iref values shows a strong correlation with the seismogenic zoning used in the calculation of PSHA following the Cornell-McGuire approach. This suggests that the adopted zoning could be incomplete (some further "hidden" sources may exist) and too rough to capture actual seismogenic sources. Because more detailed zoning is prevented by the amount of data available, the results obtained suggest the preference of zonation-free approaches for seismic hazard assessment in Italy. Furthermore, among the possible zonation-free approaches, those that offer better exploitation of local information about the effects of past earthquakes would be preferred.},

abstract = {We determine earthquake stress drops directly from the Arias intensity database of NGA-West2. Arias intensity (Arias, 1970, https://www.osti.gov/biblio/4167721) is an engineering measure proportional to the integral of the absolute value of acceleration squared, over the significant duration of the signal. As such, it is closely related to root mean square acceleration and can readily be connected to earthquake stress drop (Hanks {\&} McGuire, 1981, https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/71/6/2071/102118/the-character-of-high-frequency-strong-ground). Arias intensity records out to 100-km yield stable stress drops for moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes, M6.5+; for smaller events {\~{}}M4.5–6.5, only closer-in records yield stable results. For the 116 events considered, stress drops are about 35{\%} larger for class 1 mainshocks than for traditional on-fault class 2 aftershocks, and smaller for those aftershocks close to the main fault plane. Aftershock stress drops show large variability, however, implying that on average they rerupture weakened patches but can also rupture intact rock or high-stress asperities. We observe an increase of stress drop with earthquake depth similar to that of other studies but do not find any significant faulting mechanism dependence. The variability of the Arias intensity-based stress drop is lower than that of eGf-based stress drops from Baltay et al. (2010, https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JB006736; 2011, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011GL046698), and nearly on par with variability seen in ground-motion prediction equations. The Arias intensity stress drop is a novel and promising method to estimate stress drop without the need for path and site corrections and yields further insight into the connection between source physics and ground motion.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of forecasting future regional climate. Ourmethod is based on blending different members of an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) simu- lations while accounting for the discrepancies between these simulations, under present day conditions, and observational records for the recent past. To this end, we develop Bayesian space-timemodels that assess the discrepancies between climatemodel simu- lations and observational records. Those discrepancies are then propagated into the fu- ture to obtain blended forecasts of 21st century climate. The model allows for location- dependent spatial heterogeneities, providing local comparisons between the different simulations. Additionally, we estimate the different modes of spatial variability, and use the climate model-specific coefficients of the spatial factors for comparisons. We focus on regional climate model simulations performed in the context of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP).We consider, in particular, simulations from RegCM3 using three different forcings: NCEP, GFDL and CGCM3.We use simulations for two time periods: current climate conditions, cov- ering 1971 to 2000, and future climate conditions under the SRES A2 emissions sce- nario, covering 2041 to 2070. We investigate yearly mean summer temperature for a domain in the South West of the United States. The results indicated the RCM simu- lations underestimate the mean summer temperature increase for most of the domain compared to our model.},

We develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric method combining the nested Chinese Restaurant Process (nCRP) and the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). Compared with other existing Bayesian approaches, our solution tackles data with complex latent mixture features which has not been previously explored in the literature. We discuss the details of the model and the inference procedure. Furthermore, experiments on three datasets show that our method achieves solid empirical results in comparison with existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Approximations for an unknown density {\$}g{\$} in terms of a reference density {\$}f{\_}\backslashnu{\$} and its associated orthonormal polynomials are discussed. The main application is the approximation of the density {\$}f{\$} of a sum {\$}S{\$} of lognormals which may have different variances or be dependent. In this setting, {\$}g{\$} may be {\$}f{\$} itself or a transformed density, in particular that of {\$}\backslashlog S{\$} or an exponentially tilted density. Choices of reference densities {\$}f{\_}\backslashnu{\$} that are considered include normal, gamma and lognormal densities. For the lognormal case, the orthonormal polynomials are found in closed form and it is shown that they are not dense in {\$}L{\_}2(f{\_}\backslashnu){\$}, a result that is closely related to the lognormal distribution not being determined by its moments and provides a warning to the most obvious choice of taking {\$}f{\_}\backslashnu{\$} as lognormal. Numerical examples are presented and comparisons are made to established approaches such as the Fenton--Wilkinson method and skew-normal approximations. Also extensions to density estimation for statistical data sets and non-Gaussian copulas are outlined.},

abstract = {A time-averaged 30-m-depth shear wave velocity (VS30) map is developed for New Zealand as a weighted combination of a geology-based and a terrain-based model. A Bayesian updating process allows local VS30 measurements to control model estimates where data exist and uses model estimates developed for other parts of the world where local data are sparse or nonexistent. Geostatistical interpolation is performed on the geology-based and terrain-based models using local VS30 measurements to constrain the model in the vicinity of data. Conventional regression kriging is compared with a flexible multivariate normal (MVN) approach that allows for arbitrary assumptions regarding measurement uncertainty at each data location. A modification to the covariance structure in the MVN application allows for more realistic estimates by reducing undesirable extrapolation across geologic boundaries. The results of kriging and MVN approaches are compared. The geology-based and terrain-based MVN models are combined to produce a final model suitable for engineering applications. The 100-m resolution map outputs are publicly available.},

abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

abstract = {Despite advances in scalable models, the inference tools used for Gaussian processes (GPs) have yet to fully capitalize on developments in computing hardware. We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from {\$}O(n{\^{}}3){\$} to {\$}O(n{\^{}}2){\$}. Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

Although the grounds, contents, and implications of these distinctions differed significantly from author to author, all revolved around a philosophical distinction between "objective" and "subjective" which had emerged ca. 1840. It was this new philosophical distinction which permitted the revisionist probabilists to conceive of the possibility of "objective probabilities," which would have been an oxymoron for classical probabilists such as Jakob Bernoulli and Pierre Simon Laplace. Without relinquishing the rigid determinism of the classical probabilists, the revisionists were nonetheless able to grant chance an objective status in the world by opposing it to the subjective variability of the mind. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press.

abstract = {Homogenization of earthquake catalog being a pre-requisite for seismic hazard assessment requires region based magnitude conversion relationships. Linear Standard Regression (SR) relations fail when both the magnitudes have measurement errors. To accomplish homogenization, techniques like Orthogonal Standard Regression (OSR) are thus used. In this paper a technique is proposed for using such OSR for preparation of homogenized earthquake catalog in moment magnitude M w.For derivation of orthogonal regression relation between m b and M w, a data set consisting of 171 events with observed body wave magnitudes (m b,obs) and moment magnitude (M w,obs) values has been taken from ISC and GCMT databases for Northeast India and adjoining region for the period 1978-2006. Firstly, an OSR relation given below has been developed using m b,obs and M w,obs values corresponding to 150 events from this data set. M w=1.3(±0.004)m b,proxy-1.4(±0.130), where m b,proxy are body wave magnitude values of the points on the OSR line given by the orthogonality criterion, for observed (m b,obs, M w,obs) points. A linear relation is then developed between these 150 m b,obs values and corresponding m b,proxy values given by the OSR line using orthogonality criterion. The relation obtained is m b,proxy=0.878(±0.03)m b,obs+0.653(±0.15).The accuracy of the above procedure has been checked with the rest of the data i.e., 21 events values. The improvement in the correlation coefficient value between m b,obs and M w estimated using the proposed procedure compared to the correlation coefficient value between m b,obs and M w,obs shows the advantage of OSR relationship for homogenization.The OSR procedure developed in this study can be used to homogenize any catalog containing various magnitudes (e.g., M L, m b, M S) with measurement errors, by their conversion to unified moment magnitude M w. The proposed procedure also remains valid in case the magnitudes have measurement errors of different orders, i.e. the error variance ratio is different from unity. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Shear-waves are the most energetic body-waves radiated from an earthquake, and are responsible for the destruction of engineered structures. In both short-term emergency response and long-term risk forecasting of disaster-resilient built environment, it is critical to predict spatially accurate distribution of shear-wave amplitudes. Although decades' old theory proposes a deterministic, highly anisotropic, four-lobed shear-wave radiation pattern, from lack of convincing evidence, most empirical ground-shaking prediction models settled for an oversimplified stochastic radiation pattern that is isotropic on average. Today, using the large datasets of uniformly processed seismograms from several strike, normal, reverse, and oblique-slip earthquakes across the globe, compiled specifically for engineering applications, we could reveal, quantify, and calibrate the frequency-, distance-, and style-of-faulting dependent transition of shear-wave radiation between a stochastic-isotropic and a deterministic-anisotropic phenomenon. Consequent recalibration of empirical ground-shaking models dramatically improved their predictions: with isodistant anisotropic variations of ±40{\%}, and 8{\%} reduction in uncertainty. The outcomes presented here can potentially trigger a reappraisal of several practical issues in engineering seismology, particularly in seismic ground-shaking studies and seismic hazard and risk assessment.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes are powerful non-parametric probabilistic models for stochastic functions. However they entail a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a novel approach for low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance and practical implementation of the method in relation to key factors such as the number of basis functions, domain of the prediction space, and smoothness of the latent function. We provide intuitive visualizations and recommendations for choosing the values of these factors, which make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the domain of the prediction space are adequate given the data. The proposed approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

abstract = {The Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) is a popular approach for dimensionality reduction of single-cell data and has been used for pseudotime estimation with capture time information. However current implementations are computationally intensive and will not scale up to modern droplet-based single-cell datasets which routinely profile many tens of thousands of cells. We provide an efficient implementation which allows scaling up this approach to modern single-cell datasets. We also generalize the application of pseudotime inference to cases where there are other sources of variation, such as branching dynamics. We applied our method on microarray, nCounter, RNA-seq, qPCR and droplet-based datasets from different organisms. The model converges an order of magnitude faster compared to existing methods whilst achieving similar levels of estimation accuracy. Further, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by extending the model to higher-dimensional latent spaces that can be used to simultaneously infer pseudotime and other structure such as branching. Thus, the model has the capability of producing meaningful biological insights about cell ordering as well as cell fate regulation. Software available at github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GrandPrix},

abstract = {Unfortunately, available probabilistic seismic hazard studies are reporting significantly varying estimates for seismicity of Dubai. Given Dubai's rapid economic growth, it is crucial to assess the impact of the diverse estimates on the performance and cost of buildings. This research investigates and quantifies the impact of the high and moderate seismicity estimates of Dubai on the seismic performance and construction and repair costs of buildings with 6, 9, and 12 stories. The reference buildings are made up of reinforced concrete with special shear walls as their seismic force-resisting system. The seismic performance is investigated using nonlinear static and incremental dynamic analyses. Construction and repair costs associated with earthquake damages are evaluated to quantify the impact. Results showed that designing for higher seismicity yields significant enhancement in overall structural performance. In addition, the higher seismicity estimate resulted in slight increase in initial construction cost. However, the increase in initial investment is outweighed by significant enhancements in seismic performance and reduction in earthquake damages. This resulted in overall cost savings when reduction in repair and downtime costs are considered.},

abstract = {An estimate of the Fourier amplitude spectrum of horizontal shear-wave motion is obtained using the Brune seismic source model in the presence of anelastic attenuation, from which the root-mean-square acceleration (arms) can be calculated. Predicted spectral amplitudes and values of arms are compared to observations for 160 free-field or basement-level components of horizontal acceleration of the San Fernando earthquake. For a stress drop of 50 bars and a faulting duration of 10 sec, observed and predicted spectral amplitudes and values of arms are in reasonable agreement: the observations conform to the predicted attenuation with distance (which is frequency-dependent for spectral amplitudes and proportional to R-3/2 for arms), but exceed predicted values by an average factor of about 3. Some of this difference is attributable to azimuthal variation in source excitation and the highly nonuniform distribution of stations with azimuth; the remainder results from the high-stress drop associated with the initial rupture for this earthquake. Predictions made by the model are nonetheless in agreement, both in terms of attenuation and amplitude, with spectral amplitudes estimated by empirical models calibrated with records from a wide variety of earthquakes.},

abstract = {The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) provides an interesting way of approximating the posterior marginals of a wide range of Bayesian hierarchical models. This approximation is based on conducting a Laplace approximation of certain functions and numerical integration is extensively used to integrate some of the models parameters out. The R-INLA package offers an interface to INLA, providing a suitable framework for data analysis. Although the INLA methodology can deal with a large number of models, only the most relevant have been implemented within R-INLA. However, many other important models are not available for R-INLA yet. In this paper we show how to fit a number of spatial models with R-INLA, including its interaction with other R packages for data analysis. Secondly, we describe a novel method to extend the number of latent models available for the model parameters. Our approach is based on conditioning on one or several model parameters and fit these conditioned models with R-INLA. Then these models are combined using Bayesian model averaging to provide the final approximations to the posterior marginals of the model. Finally, we show some examples of the application of this technique in spatial statistics. It is worth noting that our approach can be extended to a number of other fields, and not only spatial statistics.},

abstract = {We introduce a new structured kernel interpolation (SKI) framework, which generalises and unifies inducing point methods for scalable Gaussian processes (GPs). SKI methods produce kernel approximations for fast computations through kernel interpolation. The SKI framework clarifies how the quality of an inducing point approach depends on the number of inducing (aka interpolation) points, interpolation strategy, and GP covariance kernel. SKI also provides a mechanism to create new scalable kernel methods, through choosing different kernel interpolation strategies. Using SKI, with local cubic kernel interpolation, we introduce KISS-GP, which is 1) more scalable than inducing point alternatives, 2) naturally enables Kronecker and Toeplitz algebra for substantial additional gains in scalability, without requiring any grid data, and 3) can be used for fast and expressive kernel learning. KISS-GP costs O(n) time and storage for GP inference. We evaluate KISS-GP for kernel matrix approximation, kernel learning, and natural sound modelling.},

Parametric attenuation relations are estimated from these data using standard least squares methods. The variance of ground acceleration is relatively large and for any given earthquake, there is a distance range for which only stations with larger than average amplitudes will trigger recording. Consequently observed accelerations at these distances are higher than the mean ground acceleration and a bias may be introduced into an attenuation relation regression by non-detection data censoring.},

We used extended coda-normalization method to determine the attenuation of P wave (Q-1(P)) and S wave (Q-1(S)). The results show that both P and S waves undergo a strong attenuation along ray paths. The values of Q-1(P) and Q-1(S), corresponding to spectral amplitude decays, show strong frequency dependence and are expressed as Q-1(P) = (0.035 +/- 0.014)f-(0.96 +/- 0.01) and Q-1(S) = (0.014 +/- 0.006)f-(0.94 +/- 0.03), respectively, in 1.5-24 Hz. The ratio Q-1(P)/Q-1(S) is found to be larger than unity for the whole frequency range. The high frequency dependence of both P- and S waves indicate the highest attenuation among the world at lower frequencies.},

abstract = {Correlations of the recorded peak acceleration, velocity and displacement, and the modified Mercalli intensity have been carried out for 57 earthquakes and 187 strong-motion accelerograms recorded in the Western United States. Correlations of peak acceleration with intensity, characterized by the data scatter exceeding one order of magnitude, have led to average peak accelerations which are higher than those reported by a majority of previous investigators. New correlations, also characterized by scatter of data of about one order of magnitude, have been presented for peak velocities and displacements of strong ground motion versus modified Mercalli intensity. Grouping of all recorded data according to the geology underlying the strong-motion accelerograph stations was carried out and permitted a study of the possible effects that local geology might have on the peaks of strong-motion acceleration, velocity, and displacement. Results of this analysis are as follows: (1) For ground shaking of a particular modified Mercalli intensity, average peak acceleration recorded on hard rock is higher by a factor less than about two than the average peak acceleration recorded on alluvium; (2) the effect of local geology on the average peak velocity leads to marginally higher peak values-on alluvium; and (3) the peak ground displacements are larger, by a factor less than two, when recorded on alluvium rather than on hard rock.},

abstract = {Discretization is a crucial preprocessing technique used for a variety of data warehousing and mining tasks. In this paper, we present a novel PCA-based unsupervised algorithm for the discretization of continuous attributes in multivariate data sets. The algorithm leverages the underlying correlation structure in the data set to obtain the discrete intervals and ensures that the inherent correlations are preserved. Previous efforts on this problem are largely supervised and consider only piecewise correlation among attributes. We consider the correlation among continuous attributes and, at the same time, also take into account the interactions between continuous and categorical attributes. Our approach also extends easily to data sets containing missing values. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on real data sets and as a preprocessing step for both classification and frequent itemset mining tasks. We show that the intervals are meaningful and can uncover hidden patterns in data. We also show that large compression factors can be obtained on the discretized data sets. The approach is task independent, i.e., the same discretized data set can be used for different data mining tasks. Thus, the data sets can be discretized, compressed, and stored once and can be used again and again.},

abstract = {A recently compiled, comprehensive, and good-quality strong-motion database of the Iranian earthquakes has been used to develop local empirical equations for the prediction of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 5{\%}-damped pseudo-spectral accelerations (PSA) up to 4.0 s. The equations account for style of faulting and four site classes and use the horizontal distance from the surface projection of the rupture plane as a distance measure. The model predicts the geometric mean of horizontal components and the vertical-to-horizontal ratio. A total of 1551 free-field acceleration time histories recorded at distances of up to 200 km from 200 shallow earthquakes (depth {\textless} 30 km) with moment magnitudes ranging from Mw 4.0 to 7.3 are used to perform regression analysis using the random effects algorithm of Abrahamson and Youngs (Bull Seism Soc Am 82:505–510, 1992), which considers between-events as well as within-events errors. Due to the limited data used in the development of previous Iranian ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and strong trade-offs between different terms of GMPEs, it is likely that the previously determined models might have less precision on their coefficients in comparison to the current study. The richer database of the current study allows improving on prior works by considering additional variables that could not previously be adequately constrained. Here, a functional form used by Boore and Atkinson (Earthquake Spect 24:99–138, 2008) and Bindi et al. (Bull Seism Soc Am 9:1899–1920, 2011) has been adopted that allows accounting for the saturation of ground motions at close distances. A regression has been also performed for the V/H in order to retrieve vertical components by scaling horizontal spectra. In order to take into account epistemic uncertainty, the new model can be used along with other appropriate GMPEs through a logic tree framework for seismic hazard assessment in Iran and Middle East region.},

abstract = {The New Madrid seismic zone is the most important regional seismic hazard in middle America, having produced several very large earthquakes in historic and geologic time. In this study we simulate time histories in Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri, for M 7.5 and M 8.0 earthquakes along two faults in the New Madrid seismic zone. Simulations are based on a well-established and calibrated finite-fault simulation program (FINSIM), which has been shown to reproduce ground motions for earthquakes of M 4-8 in eastern and western North America (Beresnev and Atkinson, 2001a). Simulations are made for representative soil profiles for each city, as well as for reference bedrock conditions (at the base of the soil profile); the effect of nonlinearity on soil amplification is considered for the soil sites. Uncertainty in the results is considered by modeling a wide range of alternative scenarios, representing the major uncertainties in input parameters. The total uncertainty in ground motions (response spectra) is about a factor of 2. Results are most sensitive to magnitude, hypocenter location (directivity effects), and maximum slip velocity. The resulting time histories and spectra for all modeled scenarios are available as an electronic supplement to this article.  Results are validated to the extent possible using the modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) observations from the 1811-1812 earthquakes. The simulated motions are consistent with MMI observations at St. Louis and Memphis. It is not possible to distinguish, based on the MMI observations, which of the M 7.5 or M 8.0 scenarios are most likely. However, we conclude that the most extreme scenarios, such as M 8.0 with high slip velocity or large directivity effects, are not likely because they would produce higher MMI values than those that were observed.

D-probabilities are useful in goodness-of-fit assessments, in comparing imperfect models, and in providing model weights to be used in model aggregation. D-probabilities avoid some of the disadvantages of Bayesian model probabilities, such as large sensitivity to prior choice, and tend to place higher weight on a greater diversity of models. In an application to linear model selection against a Gaussian process reference, we provide simple analytic forms for routine implementation and show that D-probabilities automatically penalize model complexity. Some asymptotic properties are described, and we provide interesting probabilistic interpretations of the proposed model weights. The framework is illustrated through simulation examples and an ozone data application.},

abstract = {Strong-motion observations of recent interface earthquakes along the Chilean subduction zone are evaluated with two ground-motion models (GMM). One GMM was developed with Chilean data and the other with global data. The GMM developed with local Chilean data is found to have an overall better prediction performance than the GMM developed using a global data set. Using residual analysis with the Chilean GMM as reference model due to its better performance, clear indications of an increase of short-period radiation for deeper earthquakes in north and central Chile were found, which may be related to frictional features on the interface such as interseismic coupling, as found previously for other regions, such as Japan. Also, the Iquique earthquake, which featured a clear precursory slow-slip event, exhibits mostly negative between-event residuals at short periods for earthquakes before and after the mainshock, indicating predominantly weaker short-period radiation. However, this trend is not observed in the aftershock sequence of the Illapel earthquake, which did not feature a significant slow-slip event nor precursory seismicity in its rupture area. Finally, a poor predictive performance was found for the Chilean GMM in southern Chile, overpredicting most of the observations. Based on these results, it is proposed that future local GMMs should include corrections for depth, regional effects and include earthquakes from southern Chile, as new data are becoming available in this region.},

The systems considered are: Steel Special Moment-Resisting Frame (SMRF), Concrete SMRF, Steel Dual System (SMRF with Special Steel Plates Shear Wall, SPSW), and Concrete Dual System (SMRF with Special Concrete Shear Wall, SCSW). The LFRS selection is driven by seismic setup as well as the adopted design and construction practices in Dubai. It is found that the concrete design alternatives are consistently less expensive than their steel counterparts. The steel dual system is expected to have the least damage based on its relatively lesser interstory drifts. However, this preferred performance comes at a higher initial construction cost. Conversely, the steel SMRF system is expected to have the most damage and associated repair cost due to its excessive flexibility. The two concrete alternatives are expected to have relatively moderate damage and repair costs in addition to their lesser initial construction cost. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss an extension to two popular approaches to modeling complex structures in ecological data: the generalized additive model (GAM) and the hierarchical model (HGLM). The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

abstract = {Understanding the spatially varying effects of demographic factors on the spatio-temporal variation of intestinal parasites infections is important for public health intervention and monitoring. This paper presents a hierarchical Bayesian spatially varying coefficient model to evaluate the effects demographic factors on intestinal parasites morbidities in Ghana. The modeling relied on morbidity data collected by the District Health Information Management Systems. We developed Poisson and Poisson-gamma spatially varying coefficient models. We used the demographic factors, unsafe drinking water, unsafe toilet, and unsafe liquid waste disposal as model covariates. The models were fitted using the integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA). The overall risk of intestinal parasites infection was estimated to be 10.9 per 100 people with a wide spatial variation in the district-specific posterior risk estimates. Substantial spatial variation of increasing multiplicative effects of unsafe drinking water, unsafe toilet, and unsafe liquid waste disposal occurs on the variation of intestinal parasites risk. The structured residual spatial variation widely dominates the unstructured component, suggesting that the unaccounted-for risk factors are spatially continuous in nature. The study concludes that both the spatial distribution of the posterior risk and the associated exceedance probability maps are essential for monitoring and control of intestinal parasites.},

abstract = {A new equation for predicting Japanese instrumental seismic intensities at arbitrary surface sites in Japan for Mw 5.4–8.7 and distances ranging from 10 to 1000 km was derived from approximately 30,000 observed intensities for various types of earthquakes. The equation incorporates the differences in the subsurface characteristics immediately beneath each site using VS30. The equation can also predict the abnormal intensities (which are indispensable in Japan) due to subducting slabs using the depth of the slab surface beneath each site from the Crustal Activity Modeling Program standard plate model. The prediction equation can be applied to five source types: Pacific Ocean plate (PAC) interplate, PAC intraplate, very shallow crustal, shallow (≤50 km) Philippine Sea plate (PHS) intraplate, and intermediate-depth ({\textgreater}50 km) PHS intraplate earthquakes. Although the equation is applicable at various magnitudes and distances, the standard deviations ($\sigma$) are 0.5–0.6, which are smaller than those of other equations with narrower distance ranges. Smaller $\sigma$ values were achieved by the inversion of 29,837 Japanese instrumental seismic intensities from 68 selected earthquakes of five source types with a common site effect at each station. A deep Mw 7.9 earthquake that occurred at a depth of 680 km in 2015 near the Ogasawara Islands and subjected all of Japan to long-duration shaking due to waves propagating through the mantle was effectively employed to constrain the VS30 term of the equation. The equations for PAC interplate and very shallow earthquakes were validated by seven earthquakes that were not used for the inversion; the standard deviations for these earthquakes fell in the range of 0.41–0.53. The formula for very shallow crustal earthquakes is also able to predict the intensities of PHS interplate earthquakes. Hence, this equation is useful not only for engineering applications but also for historical seismology to distinguish the source types of ancient earthquakes.},

The project followed the methodology of the SSHAC [Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee (SSHAC), 1997. Recommendations for Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis: Guidance on Uncertainty and Use of Experts. NU-REG/ CR-6372 ] procedures at its most elaborate way-level 4. Before practical implementation was to occur, a detailed review was performed including validation tests and analysis of uncertainty propagation. This paper presents the main results of the review. The review revealed that current PSHA (Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis) methodology as based on logic trees, in conjunction with the SSHAC procedures, potentially leads to a significant overestimation of the seismic hazard in areas with low seismic activity due to the inherent possibilities of unconstrained accumulation of uncertainties. The preliminary results of the project did not pass any of our logical geological-scientific benchmark tests used in our attempts to perform a validation process of the PEGASOS analysis method. Some of the problems encountered are of generic nature and shall be studied carefully before making the decision of whether or not the Swiss nuclear power industry will adopt the recommended use of SSHAC-procedures as a basis for the evaluation of the seismic hazard for individual nuclear power plant seismic PRA without correction. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The presence of deep unconsolidated deposits in the Upper Mississippi Embayment (UME) has an important impact on surface motions and has been the subject of several studies including a study by two of us, who integrated probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) with nonlinear site effects (NL). This study extends the PSHA-NL procedure to (1) incorporate a finite-fault model capable of generating near-source motions instead of using point-source models only, (2) better approximate the range of available attenuation relations for the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), (3) examine the hazard at very high levels of shaking, and (4) propagate generated rock motions through randomized soil profile properties to achieve a more consistent probabilistic procedure. The extended PSHA-NL procedure is used to develop updated depth-dependent site coefficients for the UME, which generally provides a lower hazard at short periods but a higher hazard at longer periods than current approaches. Proposed probabilistic seismic hazard maps, at selected spectral accelerations, that incorporate the proposed site effects are also presented for the UME and are systematically compared with seismic hazard maps proposed by others.},

abstract = {1. Comparison of the maximum amplitudes recorded at different epicentral distances by the torsion seismometers of the Southern California group makes it possible to rate earthquakes in this region in terms of a magnitude scale. The magnitude assigned is characteristic of the shock as a whole; it thus differs from the intensity, which varies from point to point of the affected area. 2. The magnitude of a shock is defined as the logarithm of the calculated maximum trace amplitude, expressed in microns, with which the standard short-period torsion seismometer (T0) = 0.8, V = 2,800, h = 0.8) would register that shock at an epicentral distance of 100 kilometers. 3. Shock magnitudes can be assigned in routine to the nearest half-unit, and in cases specially studied to the nearest tenth. The smallest shocks recorded are of magnitude 0; the smallest reported felt are of magnitude 1.5. Shocks of magnitude 3 are perceptible over an area some 20 kilometers in radius; those of magnitude 4.5 are capable of causing slight damage near the epicenter; those of magnitude 6 are destructive over a restricted area; those of magnitude 7.5 are at the lower limit of major earthquakes. 4. Representative shocks of various magnitudes are discussed. The Santa Monica Bay earthquake of August 30, 1930, is assigned magnitude 5.2; the Long Beach earthquake of March 10, 1933, 6.2; the Utah earthquake of March 12, 1934, 7.0; the Nevada earthquake of December 20, 1932, 7.5. 5. The amplitude registered by the torsion seismometer at the lower limit of perceptibility to persons is found to be about 50 millimeters. With a period of 0.6 of a second, which applies at moderate distances, this corresponds to an acceleration of 250 milligals. At larger distances the period of the maximum waves increases, and perceptibility decreases more rapidly than amplitude of registration. 6. Beyond 200 kilometers the maximum registered amplitude for a given shock appears to vary nearly as the inverse cube of the epicentral distance. 7. The maximum range to which the torsion seismometer usefully records shocks of various magnitudes is discussed; shocks of magnitude 2.5 and over should be detected within 500 kilometers of Pasadena. 8. Statistics of the frequency of shocks of various magnitudes are given. It is found that the seismic energy liberated in a given region during a given period is almost wholly accounted for by the larger shocks; the smaller shocks are not sufficiently frequent to contribute more than a small fraction of this energy. It follows that the smaller shocks do not appreciably mitigate the strains which are released in the larger earthquakes, but must be regarded as minor incidents in and symptoms of the accumulation of such strains.},

abstract = {This tutorial addresses geometrical issues that concern the specification of high-dimensional sampling distributions in Bayesian inversion. We illustrate that simple, low-dimensional geometrical concepts that are sometimes used to construct such distributions may become completely distorted (and even untrue) in higher dimensional problems.This has important implications for Bayesian inversion: if a convenient sampling distribution is constructed using low dimensional geometrical concepts which cause it to differ from the distribution representing our prior information, these differences can become extremely expensive to correct in higher dimensions. Indeed, theymaymakea nonlinear inversion computationally intractable when this need not be the case. A crucial factor in Bayesian inversion is, therefore, whether onefirmly believes in a particular prior distribution. If so, this distribution may constitute the most efficient sampling distribution, even in cases where it is not straight- forward to draw samples from that prior distribution. The sampling artifacts described above then become irrelevant since they represent true prior beliefs.},

abstract = {Earthquake EarlyWarning (EEW) predicts future ground shaking based on presently available data. Long ruptures present the best opportunities for EEW since many heavily shaken areas are distant from the earthquake epicentre and may receive long warning times. Predicting the shaking from large earthquakes, however, requires some estimate of the likelihood of the future evolution of an ongoing rupture. An EEW system that anticipates future rupture using the present magnitude (or rupture length) together with the Gutenberg-Richter frequency- size statistics will likely never predict a large earthquake, because of the rare occurrence of ‘extreme events'. However, it seems reasonable to assume that large slip amplitudes increase the probability for evolving into a large earthquake. To investigate the relationship between the slip and the eventual size of an ongoing rupture, we simulate suites of 1-D rupture series from stochastic models of spatially heterogeneous slip. We find that while large slip amplitudes increase the probability for the continuation of a rupture and the possible evolution into a ‘Big One', the recognition that rupture is occurring on a spatially smooth fault has an even stronger effect.We conclude that anEEWsystem for large earthquakes needs some mechanism for the rapid recognition of the causative fault (e.g., from real-time GPS measurements) and consideration of its ‘smoothness'. An EEW system for large earthquakes on smooth faults, such as the San Andreas Fault, could be implemented in two ways: the system could issue a warning, whenever slip on the fault exceeds a few metres, because the probability for a large earthquake is high and strong shaking is expected to occur in large areas around the fault. Amore sophisticated EEW system could use the present slip on the fault to estimate the future slip evolution and final rupture dimensions, and (using this information) could provide probabilistic predictions of seismic ground motions along the evolving rupture. The decision on whether an EEW system should be realized in the first or in the second way (or in a combination of both) is user-specific.},

The swift uptake of this framework for Bayesian modeling is rooted in the computational efficiency of the approach and catalyzed by the demand presented by the big data era.

Recent advances in inducing point methods have sped up GP marginal likelihood and posterior mean computations, leaving posterior covariance estimation and sampling as the remaining computational bottlenecks. In this paper we address these shortcomings by using the Lanczos algorithm to rapidly approximate the predictive covariance matrix. Our approach, which we refer to as LOVE (LanczOs Variance Estimates), substantially improves time and space complexity. In our experiments, LOVE computes covariances up to 2,000 times faster and draws samples 18,000 times faster than existing methods, all without sacrificing accuracy.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We compute LOO using Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models.

IMs considered are Spectral Accelerations with periods from 0.01s to 10s, Peak Ground Acceleration, Peak Ground Velocity, and Significant Duration (for 5-75{\%} and 5-95{\%} definitions). Results are shown for correlations of both maximum- direction and geometric mean spectral acceleration values, given the need for such maximum-direction correlations in a new ASCE 7-16 procedure. Additionally, the potential magnitude-, distance- and site-condition-dependence of IM correlations are evaluated. The results are practically important as IM correlations are increasingly used in a range of engineering and seismic hazard calculations. We find that maximum-direction spectral correlations are comparable to correlations for other spectral acceleration definitions, and that the correlations have no practically significant dependence on magnitude, distance or site conditions. These results support the collective understanding that IM correlations are stable across a range of conditions, and as a result, that existing correlation models are generally appropriate for continued use in engineering calculations.},

abstract = {Several methods have been proposed to approximate the sum of lognormal RVs. However the accuracy of each method relies highly on the region of the resulting distribution being examined, and the individual lognormal parameters, i.e., mean and variance. There is no such method which can provide the needed accuracy for all cases. This paper propose a universal yet very simple approximation method for the sum of Lognormals based on log skew normal approximation. The main contribution on this work is to propose an analytical method for log skew normal parameters estimation. The proposed method provides highly accurate approximation to the sum of lognormal distributions over the whole range of dB spreads for any correlation coefficient. Simulation results show that our method outperforms all previously proposed methods and provides an accuracy within 0.01 dB for all cases.},

abstract = {CyberShake, as part of the Southern California Earthquake Center's (SCEC) Community Modeling Environment, is developing a methodology that explicitly incorporates deterministic source and wave propagation effects within seismic hazard calculations through the use of physics-based 3D ground motion simulations. To calculate a waveform-based seismic hazard estimate for a site of interest, we begin with Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2.0 (UCERF2.0) and identify all ruptures within 200 km of the site of interest. We convert the UCERF2.0 rupture definition into multiple rupture variations with differing hypocenter locations and slip distributions, resulting in about 415,000 rupture variations per site. Strain Green Tensors are calculated for the site of interest using the SCEC Community Velocity Model, Version 4 (CVM4), and then, using reciprocity, we calculate synthetic seismograms for each rupture variation. Peak intensity measures are then extracted from these synthetics and combined with the original rupture probabilities to produce probabilistic seismic hazard curves for the site. Being explicitly site-based, CyberShake directly samples the ground motion variability at that site over many earthquake cycles (i.e., rupture scenarios) and alleviates the need for the ergodic assumption that is implicitly included in traditional empirically based calculations. Thus far, we have simulated ruptures at over 200 sites in the Los Angeles region for ground shaking periods of 2 s and longer, providing the basis for the first generation CyberShake hazard maps. Our results indicate that the combination of rupture directivity and basin response effects can lead to an increase in the hazard level for some sites, relative to that given by a conventional Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE). Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we find that the physics-based hazard results are much more sensitive to the assumed magnitude-area relations and magnitude uncertainty estimates used in the definition of the ruptures than is found in the traditional GMPE approach. This reinforces the need for continued development of a better understanding of earthquake source characterization and the constitutive relations that govern the earthquake rupture process.},

abstract = {Regional seismic risk assessments and quantification of portfolio losses oftenrequire simulation of spatially distributed ground motions at multiple intensitymeasures. For a given earthquake, distributed ground motions are character-ized by spatial correlation and correlation between different intensity measures,known as cross-correlation. This study proposes a new spatial cross-correlationmodel for within-event spectral acceleration residuals that uses a combinationof principal component analysis (PCA) and geostatistics. Records from 45 earth-quakes are used to investigate earthquake-to-earthquake trends in applicationof PCA to spectral acceleration residuals. Based on the findings, PCA is used todetermine coefficients that linearly transform cross-correlated residuals to inde-pendent principal components. Nested semivariogram models are then fit toempirical semivariograms to quantify the spatial correlation of principal compo-nents. The resultant PCA spatial cross-correlation model is shown to be accurateand computationally efficient. A step-by-step procedure and an example arepresented to illustrate the use of the predictive model for rapid simulation ofspatially cross-correlated spectral accelerations at multiple periods.},

abstract = {Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are receiving widespread attention for performing Bayesian inference in complex generative models. However, applications to science remain limited because of the impracticability of rewriting complex scientific simulators in a PPL, the computational cost of inference, and the lack of scalable implementations. To address these, we present a novel PPL framework that couples directly to existing scientific simulators through a cross-platform probabilistic execution protocol and provides Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and deep-learning-based inference compilation (IC) engines for tractable inference. To guide IC inference, we perform distributed training of a dynamic 3DCNN--LSTM architecture with a PyTorch-MPI-based framework on 1,024 32-core CPU nodes of the Cori supercomputer with a global minibatch size of 128k: achieving a performance of 450 Tflop/s through enhancements to PyTorch. We demonstrate a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) use-case with the C++ Sherpa simulator and achieve the largest-scale posterior inference in a Turing-complete PPL.},

@article{AlHamaydeh2018,
abstract = {The primary objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of Dubai's diverse seismicity estimates on the seismic response of reinforced concrete shear wall buildings. In this regard, three 12-story office buildings are designed and detailed in accordance with common practices and building codes utilized in Dubai. The buildings are designed for three possible seismic hazard estimates of Dubai (i.e., high, moderate, and low) with specially detailed shear walls. The seismic response is evaluated based on FEMA P695 methodology and fragility analysis. The methodology is based on nonlinear pseudo-static pushover and incremental dynamic analyses (IDA). Pushover analysis is performed and its results are compared against design levels. IDA is performed using the set of 22 far-field ground motion records recommended by FEMA P695. The results of this research confirm that designing for the conservative seismicity estimate significantly enhances the seismic response of the buildings. The building designed for the highest seismicity showed a favorable structural response, while the moderate seismicity design had a reasonable response. For the lowest seismicity design, results showed a poor seismic performance. Furthermore, the resulting enhancements in the seismic response reduce potential earthquake damages and collapse probabilities. Therefore, the marginal increase in initial investment is outweighed by the reduction in the buildings' life-cycle (repair and downtime) cost.},

abstract = {A collection of ground-motion recordings (1070 acceleration records) of moderate (5.1 less than or equal to M-L less than or equal to 6.5) earthquakes obtained during the execution of the Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) since 1991 was used to study source scaling model and attenuation relations for a wide range of earthquake magnitudes and distances and to verify the models developed recently for the Taiwan region. The results of the analysis reveal that the acceleration spectra of the most significant part of the records, starting from S-wave arrival, can be modelled accurately using the Prune's omega-squared source model with magnitude-dependent stress parameter Delta sigma, that should be determined using the recently proposed regional relationships between magnitude (M-L) and seismic moment (M-o) and between M-o and Delta sigma. The anelastic attenuation Q of spectral amplitudes with distance may be described as Q = 225 f(1.1) both for deep (depth more than 35 km) and shallow earthquakes. The source scaling and attenuation models allow a satisfactory prediction of the peak ground acceleration for magnitudes 5.1 less than or equal to M less than or equal to 6.5 and distances up to about 200 km in the Taiwan region, and may be useful for seismic hazard assessment.

@article{Gigerenzer2018,
abstract = {Behavioral economics began with the intention of eliminating the psychological blind spot in rational choice theory and ended up portraying psychology as the study of irrationality. In its portrayal, people have systematic cognitive biases that are not only as persis- tent as visual illusions but also costly in real life—meaning that governmental paternalism is called upon to steer people with the help of “nudges.” These biases have since attained the status of truisms. In contrast, I show that such a view of human nature is tainted by a “bias bias,” the tendency to spot biases even when there are none. This may occur by failing to notice when small sample statistics differ from large sample statistics, mistaking people's ran- dom error for systematic error, or confusing intelligent inferences with logical errors. Unknown to most economists, much of psycho- logical research reveals a different portrayal, where people appear to have largely fine-tuned intuitions about chance, frequency, and framing. A systematic review of the literature shows little evidence that the alleged biases are potentially costly in terms of less health, wealth, or happiness. Getting rid of the bias bias is a precondition for psychology to play a positive role in economics. Keywords:},

abstract = {The Ridgecrest seismic sequence began on 4 July 2019 in California, on a hitherto relatively unmapped orthogonal cross-faulting system, causing mainly nonstructural or liquefaction-related damage to buildings in the vicinity of Ridgecrest and Trona, and also causing substantial surface rupture. The present study considers the near-source ground-acceleration recordings collected during the two principal events of the sequence—the 4 July moment-magnitude M 6.4 foreshock and the 6 July M 7.1 mainshock—to identify pulse-like ground motions, which may have arisen due to forward rupture directivity. Pulse-like seismic input is of particular interest to earthquake engineering due to its peculiar spectral shape and possibly increased damaging potential, and expanding the strong-motion databases with such records is a topical issue. In this context, a pulse identification methodology is implemented, partially based on computer-aided signal processing, but also involving manual classification. Nine ground-motion records were classified as pulse-like by this procedure. Further investigation led to the conclusion that, for some of these records, the impulsive characteristics could most likely be attributable to forward rupture directivity, whereas for others fling step may have also been an issue. Finally, clear signs of directionality were observed in these ground motions at periods near the pulse duration, manifesting as a polarization of the spectral ordinates toward the orientation of the impulsive component.},

abstract = {The long recorded history of earthquakes in Japan affords an opportunity to forecast seismic shaking exclusively from past shaking. We calculate the time-averaged (Poisson) probability of severe shaking by using more than 10,000 intensity observations recorded since AD 1600 in a 350 km-wide box centered on Tokyo. Unlike other hazard-assessment methods, source and site effects are included without modeling, and we do not need to know the size or location of any earthquake nor the location and slip rate of any fault. The two key assumptions are that the slope of the observed frequency-intensity relation at every site is the same, and that the 400-year record is long enough to encompass the full range of seismic behavior. Tests we conduct here suggest that both assumptions are sound. The resulting 30-year probability of I-JMA {\textgreater}= 6 shaking (similar to PGA {\textgreater}= 0.4 g or MMI {\textgreater}= IX) is 30{\%}-40{\%} in Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama, and 10{\%}-15{\%} in Chiba and Tsukuba. This result means that there is a 30{\%} chance that 4 million people will be subjected to I-JMA {\textgreater}= 6 shaking during an average 30-year period. We also produce exceedance maps of PGA for building-code regulations, and calculate short-term hazard associated with a hypothetical catastrophe bond. Our results resemble an independent assessment developed from conventional seismic hazard analysis for greater Tokyo.},

abstract = {Iranian strong motion records as well as detailed conditions of their instrument sites and the characteristics of their causative seismic sources are compiled and processed. The dataset consists of 2286 three-component records from 461 Iranian earthquakes with at least two high-quality records having moment magnitude from 3.9 to 7.3. These records are about 20{\%} of the Iranian database and are suitable for seismic hazard analysis and engineering applications. Perhaps for the first time in the literature, the distance to the surface projection of the fault is reported for a great number of records corresponding to earthquakes with M {\textgreater} 6.0. The raw accelerations are processed using the wavelet de-noising method. Having corrected and filtered these raw data, the pseudospectral accelerations are calculated for each of the three components of time series, separately. In addition to the ground motion parameters, a large and comprehensive list of metadata characterizing the recording conditions of each record is also developed. Moreover, careful revision of the characteristics of the earthquakes such as location, magnitude, style of faulting and fault rupture plane geometry, if available, is carried out using the best available information in a scientifically sound manner. Finally, we also focus on special ground motion records including records with peak ground acceleration (PGA) {\textgreater}300 cm/s2 and distances less than 30 km. These are “exceptional” records in the Iranian dataset and include less than 2{\%} of the selected dataset.},

abstract = {The principles behind the interface to continuous domain spatial models in the R-INLA software package for R are described. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach proposed by Rue, Martino, and Chopin (2009) is a computationally effective alternative to MCMC for Bayesian inference. INLA is designed for latent Gaus-sian models, a very wide and flexible class of models ranging from (generalized) linear mixed to spatial and spatio-temporal models. Combined with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation approach (SPDE, Lindgren and Lindgren 2011), one can accommodate all kinds of geographically referenced data, including areal and geostatistical ones, as well as spatial point process data. The implementation interface covers stationary spatial models , non-stationary spatial models, and also spatio-temporal models, and is applicable in epidemiology, ecology, environmental risk assessment, as well as general geostatistics. Keywords: Bayesian inference, Gaussian Markov random fields, stochastic partial differential equations, Laplace approximation, R. Traditionally, Markov models in image analysis and spatial statistics have been largely confined to discrete spatial domains, such as lattices and regional adjacency graphs. However, as discussed in Lindgren, Rue, and Lindstr{\"{o}}m (2011), one can express a large class of random field models as solutions to continuous domain stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), and write down explicit links between the parameters of each SPDE and the elements of precision matrices for weights in a discrete basis function representation. As shown by Whittle (1963), such models include those with Mat{\'{e}}rn covariance functions, which are ubiquitous in traditional spatial statistics, but in contrast to covariance based models it is far easier to introduce non-stationarity into the SPDE models. This is because the differential operators act locally, similarly to local increments in Gibbs-specifications of Markov models, and only mild regularity conditions are required. The practical significance of this},

abstract = {We introduce a framework and early results for massively scalable Gaussian processes (MSGP), significantly extending the KISS-GP approach of Wilson and Nickisch (2015). The MSGP framework enables the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) on billions of datapoints, without requiring distributed inference, or severe assumptions. In particular, MSGP reduces the standard {\$}O(n{\^{}}3){\$} complexity of GP learning and inference to {\$}O(n){\$}, and the standard {\$}O(n{\^{}}2){\$} complexity per test point prediction to {\$}O(1){\$}. MSGP involves 1) decomposing covariance matrices as Kronecker products of Toeplitz matrices approximated by circulant matrices. This multi-level circulant approximation allows one to unify the orthogonal computational benefits of fast Kronecker and Toeplitz approaches, and is significantly faster than either approach in isolation; 2) local kernel interpolation and inducing points to allow for arbitrarily located data inputs, and {\$}O(1){\$} test time predictions; 3) exploiting block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block structure (BTTB), which enables fast inference and learning when multidimensional Kronecker structure is not present; and 4) projections of the input space to flexibly model correlated inputs and high dimensional data. The ability to handle many ({\$}m \backslashapprox n{\$}) inducing points allows for near-exact accuracy and large scale kernel learning.},

Particular attention is given to reconciling the observed spatial distribution of ground motions in terms of physical phenomena related to source, path and site effects. The large number of near-source observed strong ground motions show clear evidence of: forward-directivity, basin generated surface waves, liquefaction and other significant nonlinear site response. The pseudo-acceleration response spectra (SA) amplitudes and significant duration of strong motions agree well with empirical prediction models, except at long vibration periods where the influence of basin-generated surface waves and nonlinear site response are significant and not adequately accounted for in empirical SA models. Pseudo-acceleration response spectra are also compared with those observed in the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake and routine design response spectra used in order to emphasise the amplitude of ground shaking and elucidate the importance of local geotechnical characteristics on surface ground motions. The characteristics of the observed vertical component accelerations are shown to be strongly dependent on source-to-site distance and are comparable with those from the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake, implying the large amplitudes observed are simply a result of many observations at close distances rather than a peculiar source effect.},

In order to improve the utility of GPs we need a modular system that allows rapid implementation and testing, as seen in the neural network community. We present a mathematical and software framework for scalable approximate inference in GPs, which combines interdomain approximations and multiple outputs. Our framework, implemented in GPflow, provides a unified interface for many existing multioutput models, as well as more recent convolutional structures. This simplifies the creation of deep models with GPs, and we hope that this work will encourage more interest in this approach.},

The number of study populations has little relevance beyond a certain point, the power and precision being limited by the total number of disease events and by the size of the sample surveys used to estimate the distributions of determinants within populations. In most circumstances, optimal design requires the size of the sample surveys in each population to be related to the number of disease events which will occur in it, and for sampling to be stratified by age and/or sex.},

abstract = {This article explores the implementation of the Natural Resources Canada's Fifth Generation national seismic hazard model as developed for the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC), within the OpenQuake-engine. It also describes the reconciliation of the differences in hazard estimates relative to the published NBCC values, calculated using GSCFRISK. Source and ground-motion input models developed for the GSCFRISK software were translated to the OpenQuake-engine format for the hazard comparison. In order to successfully undertake this process, several adjustments to the OpenQuake code were needed to mimic the behavior of GSCFRISK. This required the development of new functions for earthquake-rupture scaling and ground-motion interpolation. Hazard values estimated using the OpenQuake-engine are generally in good agreement with the 2015 NBCC national-scale hazard values, with differences less than 2{\%}–3{\%} typically achieved. Where larger differences arise, they can be rationalized in terms of differences between the behaviors of the two software engines with respect to earthquake-rupture length uncertainty and maximum ground-motion integration distance.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. We illustrate how methods for non-parametric regression and classification based on Gaussian Processes can be adapted for inferring the condition state of infrastructure components under spatially distributed stressors. When the stressor is modeled by a random field, observations collected in one location can reduce the uncertainty about the stressor intensity also in other locations. Exact inference is possible when the field is Gaussian and observations are perfect or affected by Gaussian noise. However, often the available observations are binary, as those related to the failure or survival of components, and indicate whether the local field is above or below a threshold whose value may also be uncertain. While no efficient scheme for exact inference is available in that setting, we can perform efficient approximate inference when the field is Gaussian and so is the uncertainty on the threshold value. The mathematical formulation for this problem is analogous to that of classification in machine learning, that can be based on latent Gaussian processes. We show how to formulate the problem and how to adapt deterministic methods, as Laplace's method and Expectation Propagation, and methods based on random number generation, as Monte Carlo uniform sampling and importance sampling, to perform approximate inference. Our illustrative application is the condition assessment of assets exposed to a seismic event. Under specific assumptions, the seismic demand can be modeled as a Gaussian random field, and measures about the demand and about the survival and failure of assets can be processed globally, to update the risk assessment. Specifically, we evaluate methods for approximate inference and discuss their merits.},

New logic trees were developed for the recurrence parameters of M8-9 earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) and for the eastern edge of their rupture zones. These logic trees reflect recent findings of additional M8 CSZ earthquakes using offshore deposits of turbidity flows and onshore tsunami deposits and subsidence. These M8 earthquakes each rupture a portion of the CSZ and occur in the time periods between M9 earthquakes that have an average recurrence interval of about 500 years. The maximum magnitude was increased for deep intraslab earthquakes. An areal source zone to account for the possibility of deep earthquakes under western Oregon was expanded. The western portion of the Tacoma fault was added to the hazard maps.},

@article{Kumar2019,
abstract = {While conceptually simple, Bayesian methods can be mathematically and numerically challenging. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) implement functions to easily build Bayesian models together with efficient automatic inference methods. This helps separate the model building from the inference, allowing practitioners to focus on their specific problems and leaving PPLs to handle the computational details for them (Bessiere, Mazer, Ahuactzin, {\&} Mekhnacha, 2013; Daniel Roy, 2015; Ghahramani, 2015). The inference process generates a posterior distribution-which has a central role in Bayesian statistics-together with other distributions like the posterior predictive distribution and the prior predictive distribution. The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these distributions is key to properly answer the questions that motivate the inference process. When working with Bayesian models there are a series of related tasks that need to be addressed besides inference itself: • Diagnoses of the quality of the inference • Model criticism, including evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions • Comparison of models, including model selection or model averaging • Preparation of the results for a particular audience Successfully performing such tasks are central to the iterative and interactive modeling process. These tasks require both numerical and visual summaries to help statisticians or practitioners analyze visual summaries. In the words of Persi Diaconis (Diaconis, 2011) "Exploratory data analysis seeks to reveal structure, or simple descriptions in data. We look at numbers or graphs and try to find patterns. We pursue leads suggested by background information, imagination, patterns perceived, and experience with other data analyses". For these reasons we introduce ArviZ, a Python package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. ArviZ aims to be a package that integrates seamlessly with established probabilistic programming languages like PyStan ("Stan," n.},

@article{Pace2006,
abstract = {We defined a seismogenic model for central Italy based on three layers of sources and computed the relative seismic-hazard maps. One layer is constituted by individual structures liable to generate major earthquakes (M [{\&}ge;]5.5). We defined them as seismogenic boxes by using geological information in terms of plan projection of active faults; the seismicity rates associated with an individual source are based on the geometry and kinematics of the fault; the recurrence model is controlled by the earthquake-source association, and, when possible, we defined the occurrence time of the last major event, using it in a time-dependent approach. Another layer is given by the instrumental seismicity analysis of the past two decades, which allows us to evaluate the background seismicity (M [{\~{}}]{\textless}5.5); using a sliding-window selection of events, we defined a model of regular adjacent cells of variable a and b values of the Gutenberg-Richter relation. The last layer utilizes all the instrumental earthquakes and the historical events not correlated to known structures (4.5 {\textless} M [{\~{}}]{\textless}6), by separating them into seismotectonic provinces shaped on a geological-structural basis. The seismic-hazard computations first use this layered model in a traditional probabilistic scheme. The results indicate a narrow belt of peak ground acceleration (PGA) higher than 0.30g (with standard deviation in attenuation functions) in the axial part of the Apennine chain, with a maximum spot of PGA {\textgreater}0.40g southeast of the area damaged by the 1997-1998 Umbria-Marche sequence (PGA expected not to be exceeded in 50 years at 90{\%} probability level). The background seismicity gives a nonnegligible contribution to the hazard, at least for first damage levels. Then, a simplified time-dependent hypothesis has been introduced for the individual sources alone, computing the conditional probability of occurrence of characteristic earthquakes for each source by Brownian passage time distributions. Adopting equivalent fictitious seismicity rates, we obtained maps referring to the next 50 years by using traditional codes. These results show that the contribution of the recently active sources vanishes, and the most hazardous sites are now located south of L'Aquila and in the Sulmona area. We consider that the methodology and results obtained are useful for seismic risk reduction strategies.},

abstract = {A variable selection method based on probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) using penalized likelihood method is proposed. The proposed method is a two-step variable reduction method. The first step is based on the probabilistic principal component idea to identify principle components. The penalty function is used to identify important variables in each component. We then build a model on the original data space instead of building on the rotated data space through latent variables (principal components) because the proposed method achieves the goal of dimension reduction through identifying important observed variables. Consequently, the proposed method is of more practical use. The proposed estimators perform as the oracle procedure and are root-n consistent with a proper choice of regularization parameters. The proposed method can be successfully applied to high-dimensional PCA problems with a relatively large portion of irrelevant variables included in the data set. It is straightforward to extend our likelihood method in handling problems with missing observations using EM algorithms. Further, it could be effectively applied in cases where some data vectors exhibit one or more missing values at random.},

abstract = {Seismic hazard assessments in stable continental regions such as Australia face considerable challenges compared with active tectonic regions. Long earthquake recurrence intervals relative to historical records make forecasting the magnitude, rates, and locations of future earthquakes difficult. Similarly, there are few recordings of strong ground motions from moderate-to-large earthquakes to inform development and selection of appropriate ground-motion models (GMMs). Through thorough treatment of these epistemic uncertainties, combined with major improvements to the earthquake catalog, a 2018 National Seismic Hazard Assessment (NSHA18) of Australia has been undertaken. The resulting hazard levels at the 10{\%} in 50-year probability of exceedance level are in general significantly lower than previous assessments, including hazard factors used in the Australian earthquake loading standard ( AS 1170.4–2007 (R2018)), demonstrating our evolving understanding of seismic hazard in Australia. The key reasons for the decrease in seismic hazard factors are adjustments to catalog magnitudes for earthquakes in the early instrumental period, and the use of modern ground-motion attenuation models. This article summarizes the development of the NSHA18 explores uncertainties associated with the hazard model, and identifies the dominant factors driving the resulting changes in hazard compared with previous assessments.},

abstract = {Automated sensing instruments on satellites and aircraft have enabled the collection of massive amounts of high-resolution observations of spatial fields over large spatial regions. If these datasets can be efficiently exploited, they can provide new insights on a wide variety of issues. However, traditional spatial-statistical techniques such as kriging are not computationally feasible for big datasets. We propose a multi-resolution approximation (M-RA) of Gaussian processes observed at irregular locations in space. The M-RA process is specified as a linear combination of basis functions at multiple levels of spatial resolution, which can capture spatial structure from very fine to very large scales. The basis functions are automatically chosen to approximate a given covariance function, which can be nonstationary. All computations involving the M-RA, including parameter inference and prediction, are highly scalable for massive datasets. Crucially, the inference algorithms can also be parallelized to take full advantage of large distributed-memory computing environments. In comparisons using simulated data and a large satellite dataset, the M-RA outperforms a related state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Many empirical relationships for the earthquake ground motion duration were developed for interplate region, whereas only a very limited number of empirical relationships exist for intraplate region. Also, the existing relationships were developed based mostly on the scaled recorded interplate earthquakes to represent intraplate earthquakes. To the author's knowledge, none of the existing relationships for the intraplate regions were developed using only the data from intraplate regions. Therefore, an attempt is made in this study to develop empirical predictive relationships of earthquake ground motion duration (i.e., significant and bracketed) with earthquake magnitude, hypocentral distance, and site conditions (i.e., roc k and soil sites) using the data compiled from intraplate regions of Canada, Australia, Peninsular India, and the central and southern parts of the USA. The compiled earthquake ground motion data consists of 600 records with moment magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 6.5 and hypocentral distances ranging from 4 to 1000 km. The non-linear mixed-effect (NLMEs) and logistic regression techniques (to account for zero duration) were used to fit predictive models to the duration data. The bracketed duration was found to be decreased with an increase in the hypocentral distance and increased with an increase in the magnitude of the earthquake. The significant duration was found to be increased with the increase in the magnitude and hypocentral distance of the earthquake. Both significant and bracketed durations were predicted higher in rock sites than in soil sites. The predictive relationships developed herein are compared with the existing relationships for interplate and intraplate regions. The developed relationship for bracketed duration predicts lower durations for rock and soil sites. However, the developed relationship for a significant duration predicts lower durations up to a certain distance and thereafter predicts higher durations compared to the existing relationships.},

@article{Kuehn2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. A partially non-ergodic ground-motion prediction equation is estimated for Europe and the Middle East. Therefore, a hierarchical model is presented that accounts for regional differences. For this purpose, the scaling of ground-motion intensity measures is assumed to be similar, but not identical in different regions. This is achieved by assuming a hierarchical model, where some coefficients are treated as random variables which are sampled from an underlying global distribution. The coefficients are estimated by Bayesian inference. This allows one to estimate the epistemic uncertainty in the coefficients, and consequently in model predictions, in a rigorous way. The model is estimated based on peak ground acceleration data from nine different European/Middle Eastern regions. There are large differences in the amount of earthquakes and records in the different regions. However, due to the hierarchical nature of the model, regions with only few data points borrow strength from other regions with more data. This makes it possible to estimate a separate set of coefficients for all regions. Different regionalized models are compared, for which different coefficients are assumed to be regionally dependent. Results show that regionalizing the coefficients for magnitude and distance scaling leads to better performance of the models. The models for all regions are physically sound, even if only very few earthquakes comprise one region.},

abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In principle, probability is uniquely appropriate for the representation and quantification of all forms of uncertainty; it is in this sense that we claim that 'probability is perfect'. In practice, people find it difficult to express their knowledge and beliefs in probabilistic form, so that elicitation of probability distributions is a far from perfect process. We therefore argue that there is no need for alternative theories, but that any practical elicitation of expert knowledge must fully acknowledge imprecision in the resulting distribution. We outline a recently developed Bayesian technique that allows the imprecision in elicitation to be formulated explicitly, and apply it to some of the challenge problems. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent work shows that inference for Gaussian processes can be performed efficiently using iterative methods that rely only on matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs). Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) exploits these techniques by deriving approximate kernels with very fast MVMs. Unfortunately, such strategies suffer badly from the curse of dimensionality. We develop a new technique for MVM based learning that exploits product kernel structure. We demonstrate that this technique is broadly applicable, resulting in linear rather than exponential runtime with dimension for SKI, as well as state-of-the-art asymptotic complexity for multi-task GPs.},

abstract = {Distance sampling is a widely used method for estimating wildlife population abundance. The fact that conventional distance sampling methods are partly design-based constrains the spatial resolution at which animal density can be estimated using these methods. Estimates are usually obtained at survey stratum level. For an endangered species such as the blue whale, it is desirable to estimate density and abundance at a finer spatial scale than stratum. Temporal variation in the spatial structure is also important. We formulate the process generating distance sampling data as a thinned spatial point process and propose model-based inference using a spatial log-Gaussian Cox process. The method adopts a flexible stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to model spatial structure in density that is not accounted for by explanatory variables, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for Bayesian inference. It allows simultaneous fitting of detection and density models and permits prediction of density at an arbitrarily fine scale. We estimate blue whale density in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from thirteen shipboard surveys conducted over 22 years. We find that higher blue whale density is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in space, and although there is some positive association between density and mean annual temperature, our estimates are consistent with no trend in density across years. Our analysis also indicates that there is substantial spatially structured variation in density that is not explained by available covariates.},

abstract = {AbstractThis paper details an integrated method for the multi-hazard risk assessment of road infrastructure systems exposed to potential earthquake and flood events. A harmonisation effort is required to reconcile bridge fragility models and damage scales from different hazard types: this is achieved by the derivation of probabilistic functionality curves, which express the probability of reaching or exceeding a loss level given the seismic intensity measure. Such probabilistic tools are essential for the loss assessment of infrastructure systems, since they directly provide the functionality losses instead of the physical damage states. Multi-hazard interactions at the vulnerability level are ensured by the functionality loss curves, which result from the assembly of hazard-specific fragility curves for local damage mechanisms. At the hazard level, the potential overlap between earthquake and flood events is represented by a time window during which the effects of one hazard type on the infrastructure may still be present: the value of this temporal parameter is based on the repair duration estimates provided by the functionality loss curves. The proposed framework is implemented through Bayesian Networks, thus enabling the propagation of uncertainties and the computation of joint probabilities. The procedure is demonstrated on a bridge example and a hypothetical road network.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Grace Scientific Publishing, LLC. Sampling from a truncated multivariate distribution subject to multiple linear inequality constraints is a recurring problem in many areas in statistics and econometrics, such as the order-restricted regressions, censored data models, and shape-restricted nonparametric regressions. However, the sampling problem remains nontrivial due to the analytically intractable normalizing constant of the truncated multivariate distribution. We first develop an efficient rejection sampling method for the truncated univariate normal distribution, and analytically establish its superiority in terms of acceptance rates compared to some of the popular existing methods. We then extend our methodology to obtain samples from a truncated multivariate normal distribution subject to convex polytope restriction regions. Finally, we generalize the sampling method to truncated scale mixtures of multivariate normal distributions. Empirical results are presented to illustrate the superior performance of our proposed Gibbs sampler in terms of various criteria (e.g., mixing and integrated auto-correlation time).},

abstract = {The key operation in Bayesian inference is to compute high-dimensional integrals. An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to Pierre-Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second-order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA approach, the R-INLA package, why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute, and why LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing.},

abstract = {This paper examines the constraints to the downdip landward limit of rupture for the Cascadia great earthquakes off western North America. This limit is a primary control for ground motion hazard at near-coastal cities. The studies also provide information on the physical controls of subduction thrust rupture globally. The constraints are (1) "locked/transition" zones from geodetic deformation (GPS, repeated leveling, tide gauges); (2) rupture zone from paleoseismic coastal marsh subsidence, "paleogeodesy"; (3) temperature on the thrust for the seismic-aseismic transition; (4) change in thrust seismic reflection character downdip from thin seismic to thick ductile; (5) fore-arc mantle corner aseismic serpentinite and talc overlying the thrust; (6) updip limit of episodic tremor and slip (ETS) slow slip; (7) rupture area associations with shelf-slope basins; (8) depth limit for small events on the thrust; and (9) landward limit of earthquakes on the Nootka transform fault zone. The most reliable constraints for the limit of large rupture displacement, {\textgreater}10 m, are generally just offshore in agreement with thermal control for this hot subduction zone, but well-offshore central Oregon and near the coast of northern Washington. The limit for 1-2 m rupture that can still provide strong shaking is less well estimated 25-50 km farther landward. The fore-arc mantle corner and the updip extent of ETS slow slip are significantly landward from the other constraints. Surprisingly, there is a downdip gap between the best other estimates for the great earthquake rupture zone and the ETS slow slip. In this gap, plate convergence may occur as continuous slow creep.

abstract = {We have used the Artificial Neural Network method (ANN) for the derivation of physically sound, easy-to-handle, predictive ground-motionmodels from a subset of the Reference database for Seismic ground-motion prediction in Europe (RESORCE). Only shallow earthquakes (depth smaller than 25 km) and recordings corresponding to stations with measured Vs30 properties have been selected. Five input parameters were selected: the moment magnitude MW, the Joyner–Boore distance RJ B, the focal mechanism, the hypocentral depth, and the site proxy VS30. A feed-forward ANN type is used, with one 5-neuron hidden layer, and an output layer grouping all the considered ground motion parameters, i.e., peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV) and 5{\%}-damped pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) at 62 periods from 0.01 to 4 s. A procedure similar to the random-effects approach was developed to provide between and within event standard deviations. The total standard deviation ($\sigma$) varies between 0.298 and 0.378 (log10 unit) depending on the period, with between-event and within-event variabilities in the range 0.149–0.190 and 0.258–0.327, respectively. Those values prove comparable to those of conventional GMPEs. Despite the absence of any a priori assumption on the functional dependence, our results exhibit a number of physically sound features: magnitude scaling of the distance dependency, near-fault sat-uration distance increasing with magnitude, amplification on soft soils and even indications for nonlinear effects in softer soils.},

We study the challenges involved in applying a flexible non-stationary model to a dataset of annual precipitation in the conterminous US, where exploratory data analysis shows strong evidence of a non-stationary covariance structure. The aim of this paper is to investigate the modelling pipeline once non-stationarity has been detected in spatial data. We show that there is a real danger of over-fitting the model and that careful modelling is necessary in order to properly account for varying second-order structure. In fact, the example shows that sometimes non-stationary Gaussian random fields are not necessary to model non-stationary spatial data.},

@article{Mahmoudi2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Techno-Press, Ltd. Recently, seismic hazard analysis has become a very significant issue. New systems and available data have been also developed that could help scientists to explain the earthquakes phenomena and its physics. Scientists have begun to accept the role of uncertainty in earthquake issues and seismic hazard analysis. However, handling the existing uncertainty is still an important problem and lack of data causes difficulties in precisely quantifying uncertainty. Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE) values are usually obtained in a statistical method: regression analysis. Each of these GMPEs uses the preliminary data of the selected earthquake. In this paper, a new fuzzy method was proposed to select suitable GMPE at every intensity (earthquake magnitude) and distance (site distance to fault) according to preliminary data aggregation in their area using a cut. The results showed that the use of this method as a GMPE could make a significant difference in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) results instead of selecting one equation or using logic tree. Also, a practical example of this new method was described in Iran as one of the world's earthquake-prone areas.},

abstract = {The 2019 Ridgecrest, California, earthquake sequence, including an Mw 6.4 event on 4 July and an Mw 7.1 approximately 34 hr later, was recorded by 15 instruments within 55 km nearest-fault distance. To characterize and explore near-field ground motions from the Mw 6.4 foreshock and Mw 7.1 mainshock, we augment these records with available macroseismic information, including conventional intensities and displaced rocks. We conclude that near-field shaking intensities were generally below modified Mercalli intensity 9, with concentrations of locally high values toward the northern and southern termini of the mainshock rupture. We further show that, relative to near-field ground motions at hard-rock sites, instrumental ground motions at alluvial near-field sites for both the Mw 6.4 foreshock and Mw 7.1 mainshock were depleted in energy at frequencies higher than 2–3 Hz, as expected from ground-motion models. Both the macroseismic and instrumental observations suggest that sediments in the Indian Wells Valley experienced a pervasively nonlinear response, which helps explain why shaking intensities and damage in the closest population center, Ridgecrest, were relatively modest given its proximity to the earthquakes.},

abstract = {For the purpose of sensitivity testing and illuminating nonconsensus components of time-dependent models, the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) has assembled a time-dependent version of its statewide probabilistic seismic hazard (PSH) model for California. The model incorporates available consensus information from within the earth-science community, except for a few faults or fault segments where consensus information is not available. For these latter faults, published information has been incorporated into the model. As in the 1996 CDMG/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) model, the time-dependent models incorporate three multisegment ruptures: a 1906, an 1857, and a southern San Andreas earthquake. Sensitivity tests are presented to show the effect on hazard and expected damage estimates of (1) intrinsic (aleatory) sigma, (2) multisegment (cascade) vs. independent segment (no cascade) ruptures, and (3) time-dependence vs. time-independence. Results indicate that (1) differences in hazard and expected damage estimates between time-dependent and independent models increase with decreasing intrinsic sigma, (2) differences in hazard and expected damage estimates between full cascading and not cascading are insensitive to intrinsic sigma, (3) differences in hazard increase with increasing return period (decreasing probability of occurrence), and (4) differences in moment-rate budgets increase with decreasing intrinsic sigma and with the degree of cascading, but are within the expected uncertainty in PSH time-dependent modeling and do not always significantly affect hazard and expected damage estimates.},

abstract = {Typical Bayesian methods for models with latent variables (or random effects) involve directly sampling the latent variables along with the model parameters. In high-level software code for model definitions (using, e.g., BUGS, JAGS, Stan), the likelihood is therefore specified as conditional on the latent variables. This can lead researchers to perform model comparisons via conditional likelihoods, where the latent variables are considered model parameters. In other settings, however, typical model comparisons involve marginal likelihoods where the latent variables are integrated out. This distinction is often overlooked despite the fact that it can have a large impact on the comparisons of interest. In this paper, we clarify and illustrate these issues, focusing on the comparison of conditional and marginal Deviance Information Criteria (DICs) and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAICs) in psychometric modeling. The conditional/marginal distinction corresponds to whether the model should be predictive for the clusters that are in the data or for new clusters (where "clusters" typically correspond to higher-level units like people or schools). Correspondingly, we show that marginal WAIC corresponds to leave-one-cluster out (LOcO) cross-validation, whereas conditional WAIC corresponds to leave-one-unit out (LOuO). These results lead to recommendations on the general application of the criteria to models with latent variables.},

abstract = {Gaussian random fields (GRFs) are important building blocks in hierarchical models for spatial data, but their parameters typically cannot be consistently estimated under in-fill asymptotics. Even for stationary Mat$\backslash$'ern GRFs, the posteriors for range and marginal variance do not contract and for non-stationary models there is a high risk of overfitting the data. Despite this, there has been no practically useful, principled approach for selecting the prior on their parameters, and the prior typically must be chosen in an $\backslash$emph{\{}ad-hoc{\}} manner. We propose to construct priors such that simpler models are preferred, i.e. shrinking stationary GRFs towards infinite range and no effect, and shrinking non-stationary extensions towards stationary GRFs. We use the recent Penalised Complexity prior framework to construct a practically useful, tunable, weakly informative joint prior on the range and the marginal variance for a Mat$\backslash$'ern GRF with fixed smoothness. We then introduce extra flexibility in the covariance structure of the GRF through covariates and discuss how to extend the stationary prior. We apply the priors to a dataset of annual precipitation in southern Norway and show that the scheme for selecting the hyperparameters of the non-stationary extension leads to improved predictive performance over the stationary model.},

@article{Lenzi2019,
abstract = {Environmental processes resolved at a sufficiently small scale in space and time will inevitably display non-stationary behavior. Such processes are both challenging to model and computationally expensive when the data size is large. Instead of modeling the global non-stationarity explicitly, local models can be applied to disjoint regions of the domain. The choice of the size of these regions is dictated by a bias-variance trade-off; large regions will have smaller variance and larger bias, whereas small regions will have higher variance and smaller bias. From both the modeling and computational point of view, small regions are preferable to better accommodate the non-stationarity. However, in practice, large regions are necessary to control the variance. We propose a novel Bayesian three-step approach that allows for smaller regions without compromising the increase of the variance that would follow. We are able to propagate the uncertainty from one step to the next without issues caused by reusing the data. The improvement in inference also results in improved prediction, as our simulated example shows. We illustrate this new approach on a data set of simulated high-resolution wind speed data over Saudi Arabia.},

However, the adoption of such techniques by the general psychology community is still fairly limited. This tutorial aims to provide non-technicians with an accessible guide to PyMC3, a robust probabilistic programming language that allows for straightforward Bayesian data analysis. We focus on a series of increasingly complex Gaussian mixture models-building up from fitting basic univariate models to more complex multivariate models fit to real-world data. We also explore how PyMC3 can be configured to obtain significant increases in computational speed by taking advantage of a machine's GPU, in addition to the conditions under which such acceleration can be expected. All example analyses are detailed with step-by-step instructions and corresponding Python code.},

@article{VerHoef2018,
abstract = {Ecological data often exhibit spatial pattern, which can be modeled as autocorrelation. Conditional autoregressive (CAR) and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models are network-based models (also known as graphical models) specifically designed to model spatially autocorrelated data based on neighborhood relationships. We identify and discuss six different types of practical ecological inference using CAR and SAR models, including: 1) model selection, 2) spatial regression, 3) estimation of autocorrelation, 4) estimation of other connectivity parameters, 5) spatial prediction, and 6) spatial smoothing. We compare CAR and SAR models, showing their development and connection to partial correlations. Special cases, such as the intrinsic autoregressive model (IAR), are described. CAR and SAR models depend on weight matrices, whose practical development uses neighborhood definition and row-standardization. Weight matrices can also include ecological covariates and connectivity structures, which we emphasize, but have been rarely used. Trends in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in southeastern Alaska from 463 polygons, some with missing data, are used to illustrate the six inference types. We develop a variety of weight matrices and CAR and SAR spatial regression models are fit using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Profile likelihood graphs illustrate inference for covariance parameters. The same data set is used for both prediction and smoothing, and the relative merits of each are discussed. We show the nonstationary variances and correlations of a CAR model and demonstrate the effect of row-standardization. We include several take-home messages for CAR and SAR models, including 1) choosing between CAR and IAR models, 2) modeling ecological effects in the covariance matrix, 3) the appeal of spatial smoothing, and 4) how to handle isolated neighbors. We highlight several reasons why ecologists will want to make use of autoregressive models, both directly and in hierarchical models, and not only in explicit spatial settings, but also for more general connectivity models.

Using a hybrid parallelization approach that uses both threading (shared memory) and message-passing (distributed memory), we implement the core linear algebra operations used in spatial statistics and Gaussian process regression in an R package called bigGP that relies on C and MPI. The approach divides the matrix into blocks such that the computational load is balanced across processes while communication between processes is limited. The package provides an API enabling R programmers to implement Gaussian process-based methods by using the distributed linear algebra operations without any C or MPI coding. We illustrate the approach and software by analyzing an astrophysics dataset with n=67,275 observations.},

We present probabilistic (Bayesian) versions of both Markov chain and Quasi Monte Carlo methods for integration and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for convergence rates, in both posterior mean and posterior contraction. The performance of probabilistic integrators is guaranteed to be no worse than non-probabilistic integrators and is, in many cases, asymptotically superior. These probabilistic integrators therefore enjoy the "best of both worlds", leveraging the sampling efficiency of advanced Monte Carlo methods whilst being equipped with valid probabilistic models for uncertainty quantification. Several applications and illustrations are provided, including examples from computer vision and system modelling using non-linear differential equations.

abstract = {On 23 October 1904, the area of the Oslofjord was struck by an MS 5.4 earthquake that was felt over much of northern Europe. We collected information available from seismological bulletins of the time and also seismogram copies from a number of seismic stations in Europe. This allowed, for the first time for this earthquake, an instrumental epicentral location, even if the observation capabilities at that time were poor due to low seismograph amplification and timing problems. After a careful selection and weighting of published onset times, the reported observations from the seismic stations in Uppsala, Hamburg, Potsdam, Gottingen, Leipzig, and Tartu could be used for this instrumental location of the event. We also performed an inversion of the available macroseismic observations, based on the kinematic function (KF) for the radiation of body waves from a line source. Because the problem is nonlinear and also bimodal for pure dip-slip mechanisms, we used a sharing niching genetic algorithm to perform the inversion. The new epicenter obtained from the KF intensity inversion is consistent with the new instrumental solution, giving a location in the lower crust (25-30 km) and close to the eastern coast of the Oslofjord, near the junction of two major fault zones. The KF inversion was moreover able to constrain the fault-plane mechanism with an almost vertical rupture plane striking north-northeast-south-southwest (206{\{}degrees{\}}-212{\{}degrees{\}}) with a mixed mechanism (approximately 64{\{}degrees{\}} rake angle), the ambiguity of which is resolved by the polarities of the Pn onset observed on the horizontal components of the Uppsala Wiechert seismograph. The magnitude of the event has previously been assessed to MS 5.4, based on the size of the felt area observations, and a value of MS[{\~{}}]5.4 has now been independently confirmed both through the new intensity inversion and through the instrumental data.

abstract = {On 30 November 2018, three felt earthquakes occurred in the Septimus region of northeast British Columbia in an area where hydraulic fracturing was in progress. The proximity of oil and gas activities to populated areas and to critical infrastructure including major dams raises significant concern regarding the seismic hazard posed by moderate induced events and motivates study of their ground motions. Here, we analyze the ground-motion amplitudes from these events recorded between 3 and 400 km. We use three-component waveforms from 45 seismometer and accelerometer sensors to analyze the observed ground motions. The moment magnitude (Mw) of the first event is estimated as 4.6 using the vertical pseudoresponse spectral acceleration (PSA) based on the relations provided by Novakovic et al. (2018). The Mw for the two smaller earthquakes are 3.5 and 4.0. The intensity of shaking from the Mw 4.6 and 4.0 events generally exceeded modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) VI at distances {\textless}6 km. The maximum duration above the MMI VI threshold at the closest station (3.5 km distance) from the mainshock is 1.6 s. The observed ground motions agree with the ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE) of Novakovic et al. (2018) for induced events in Oklahoma, with attenuation modified to match that for the study region, assuming typical regional site amplification. The inferred value of stress drop for the mainshock and the largest aftershock is approximately 50 bars based on the agreement of observed PSA values with the Novakovic et al. (2018) GMPE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we separate the residuals of ground motion prediction equations into different components, calculating the repeatable site-specific ( {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta S2S{\_}{\{}s{\}}{\$}{\$} {\$}\delta{\$} S 2 S s ), location-specific ( {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta L2L{\_}{\{}r{\}}{\$}{\$} {\$}\delta{\$} L 2 L r ) and path-specific ( {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta P2P{\_}{\{}er{\}}{\$}{\$} {\$}\delta{\$} P 2 P e r ) correction for the median model. In this way, we can reduce the total standard deviation (sigma) of the ground-motion model by Lanzano et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 106(1):73--92, 2016), removing these components and overcome the ergodic assumption. These repeatable terms are empirically estimated using a dataset composed by acceleration waveforms of Italian events mainly occurred in the Po plain and Eastern Alps (Northern Italy), in the time interval 1976--2015. The analysis is carried out on 2241 recordings, from 88 shallow earthquakes recorded by 168 sites. A local model, specifically tailored for Northern Italy, is used as the reference GMPE, which predicts the geometric mean of the horizontal peak ground accelerations and response spectral ordinates in the period range 0.04--4 s. Because most of the propagation paths sampled only once, the path-specific components and the resulting aleatory variability are also calculated from the spatial correlation of residuals, following the approach of Lin et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 101(5):2281--2295, 2011). We find a significant reduction of the overall ground motion variability to an extent comparable to what observed from previous studies on empirical and simulated datasets. The estimated median corrections and variance components can be used in probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for a single site and a single path in Northern Italy. As an example, we compute the hazard curves at some sites by means of three different approaches (ergodic, partially non-ergodic and full non-ergodic), in order to quantify the impact of relaxing the ergodic assumption.},

abstract = {We perform a spectral decomposition of the Fourier amplitude spectra disseminated along with the Engineering Strong Motion (ESM) flat file for Europe and Middle East. We apply a non-parametric inversion schema to isolate source, propagation and site effects, introducing a regionalization for the attenuation model into three domains. The obtained propagation and source components of the model are parametrized in terms of geometrical spreading, quality factor, seismic moment, and corner frequency assuming a $\omega$2 source model. The non-parametric spectral attenuation values show a faster decay for earthquakes in Italy than in the other regions. Once described in terms of geometrical spreading and frequency-dependent quality factor, slopes and breakpoint locations of the piece-wise linear model for the geometrical spreading show regional variations, confirming that the non-parametric models capture the effects of crustal heterogeneities and differences in the anelastic attenuation. Since they are derived in the framework of a single inversion, the source spectra of the largest events which have occurred in Europe in the last decades can be directly compared and the scaling of the extracted source parameters evaluated. The Brune stress drop varies over about 2 orders of magnitude (the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of the ∆$\sigma$ distribution are 0.76, 2.94, and 13.07 MPa, respectively), with large events having larger stress drops. In particular, the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles for M {\textgreater} 5.5 are 2.87, 6.02, and 23.5 MPa, respectively whereas, for M {\textless} 5.5, the same percentiles are 0.73, 2.84, and 12.43 MPa. If compared to the residual distributions associated to a ground motion prediction equation previously derived using the same Fourier amplitude spectra, the source parameter and the empirical site amplification effects correlate well with the inter-event and inter-station residuals, respectively. Finally, we calibrated both non-parametric and parametric attenuation models for estimating the stress drop from the ratio between Arias intensity and significant duration. The results confirm that computing the Arias stress drop is a suitable approach for complementing the seismic moment with information controlling the source radiation at high frequencies for rapid response applications.},

abstract = {Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are essential tools in seismic hazard studies to estimate ground motions generated by potential seismic sources. Global GMPEs which are based on well-compiled global strong-motion databanks, have certain advantages over local GMPEs, including more sophisticated parameters in terms of distance, faulting style, and site classification but cannot guarantee the local/region-specific propagation characteristics of shear wave (e.g., geometric spreading behavior, quality factor) for different seismic regions at larger distances (beyond about 80 km). Here, strong-motion records of northern Iran have been used to estimate the propagation characteristics of shear wave and determine the region-specific adjustment parameters for three of the NGA-West2 GMPEs to be applicable in northern Iran. The dataset consists of 260 three-component records from 28 earthquakes, recorded at 139 stations, with moment magnitudes between 4.9 and 7.4, horizontal distance to the surface projection of the rupture (RJB) less than 200 km, and average shear-wave velocity over the top 30 m of the subsurface (VS30) between 155 and 1500 m/s. The paper also presents the ranking results for three of the NGA-West2 GMPEs against strong motions recorded in northern Iran, before and after adjustment for region-dependent attenuation characteristics. The ranking is based on the likelihood and log-likelihood methods (LH and LLH) proposed by Scherbaum et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 94: 2164–2185, 2004, Bull Seismol Soc Am 99, 3234–3247, 2009, respectively), the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (Nash and Sutcliffe, J Hydrol 10:282–290, 1970), and the EDR method of Kale and Akkar (Bull Seismol Soc Am 103:1069–1084, 2012). The best-fitting models over the whole frequency range are the ASK14 and BSSA14 models. Taking into account that the models' performances were boosted after applying the adjustment factors, at least moderate regional variation of ground motions is highlighted. The regional adjustment based on the Iranian database reveals an upward trend (indicated as high Q factor) for the selected database. Further investigation to determine adjustment factors based on a much richer database of the Iranian strong-motion records is of utmost important for seismic hazard and risk analysis studies in northern Iran, containing major cities including the capital city of Tehran.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are a good choice for function approximation as they are flexible, robust to overfitting, and provide well-calibrated predictive uncertainty. Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer generalizations of GPs, but inference in these models has proved challenging. Existing approaches to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force independence between the layers, and do not work well in practice. We present a doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm that does not force independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a billion points. We provide strong empirical evidence that our inference scheme for DGPs works well in practice in both classification and regression.},

The probability of failure associated with a failure criterion (e.g. the maximal inter-storey drift ratio being greater than a prescribed threshold) is represented as a function of the intensity of the earthquake ground motion (e.g. peak ground acceleration or spectral acceleration). The classical approach consists in assuming a lognormal shape of the fragility curves. In this paper, we introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves without making any assumption, namely the conditional Monte Carlo simulation and the kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility curves of a 3-storey steel structure, accounting for the nonlinear behavior of the system. The curves obtained by the proposed approaches are compared with each other and with those obtained using the classical lognormal assumption.},

While there are many existing software packages for this task, this package focuses on the unique setting of learning large networks from high-dimensional data, possibly with interventions. As such, the methods provided place a premium on scalability and consistency in a high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, in the presence of interventions, the methods implemented here achieve the goal of learning a causal network from data. Additionally, the sparsebn package is fully compatible with existing software packages for network analysis.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient methodology for propagating the epistemic uncertainty in the median ground motion in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is developed using the polynomial chaos (PC) approach. For this application, the epistemic uncertainty in the median ground motion for a specific scenario is assumed to be lognormally distributed and fully correlated across earthquake scenarios. In the hazard calculation, a single central ground‐motion model (GMM) is used for the median along with the epistemic standard error of the median for each scenario. A set of PC coefficients is computed for each scenario and each test ground‐motion level. The additional computation burden in computing these PC coefficients depends on the order of the approximation but is less than computing the median ground motion from one additional GMM. With the PC method, the mean and fractiles of the hazard due to the epistemic uncertainty distribution of the median ground motion are computed as a postprocess that is very fast computationally. For typical values of the standard deviation of epistemic uncertainty in the median ground motion ({\textless}0.2 natural log units), the methodology accurately estimates the epistemic uncertainty distribution of the hazard over the 1{\%}–99{\%} range. This full epistemic range is not well modeled with just a small number of GMM branches uses in the traditional logic‐tree approach. The PC method provides more accuracy, faster computation, and reduced memory requirements than the traditional approach. For large values of the epistemic uncertainty in the median ground motion, a higher order of the PC expansion may be needed to be included to capture the full range of the epistemic uncertainty.},

abstract = {We derive a set of regional ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) in the Fourier amplitude spectra (FAS-GMPE) and in the spectral acceleration (SAGMPE) domains for the purpose of interpreting the between-event residuals in terms of source parameter variability. We analyze a dataset of about 65,000 recordings generated by 1400 earthquakes (moment magnitude 2:5 ≤ Mw ≤ 6:5, hypocentral distance Rhypo ≤ 150 km) that occurred in central Italy between January 2008 and October 2017. In a companion article (Bindi, Spallarossa, et al., 2018), the nonparametric acceleration source spectra were interpreted in terms of W-square models modified to account for deviations from a high-frequency flat plateau through a parameter named ksource. Here, the GMPEs are derived considering the moment (Mw), the local (ML), and the energy (Me) magnitude scales, and the between-event residuals are computed as random effects. We show that the between-event residuals for the FAS-GMPE implementing Mw are correlated with stress drop, with correlation coefficients increasing with increasing frequency up to about 10 Hz. Contrariwise, the correlation is weak for the FASGMPEs implementing ML andMe, in particular between 2 and 5 Hz, where most of the corner frequencies lie. At higher frequencies, all models show a strong correlation with k source . The correlation with the source parameters reflects in a different behavior of the standard deviation Τ of the between-event residuals with frequency. Although is smaller for the FAS-GMPE using M w below 1.5 Hz, at higher frequencies, the model implementing either M L or M e shows smaller values, with a reduction of about 30{\%} at 3 Hz (i.e., from 0.3 for M w to 0.1 for M L ). We conclude that considering magnitude scales informative for the stress-drop variability allows to reduce the between-event variability with a significant impact on the hazard assessment, in particular for studies in which the ergodic assumption on site is removed. Electronic Supplement: Tables of the source parameters of 1365 earthquakes considered in this study, coefficients of the ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) derived for the Fourier amplitude spectra, and coefficients of the GMPEs derived for the spectral acceleration (SA) considering M w and M e .},

@article{Vallee2011,
abstract = {Accurate and fast magnitude determination for large, shallow earthquakes is of key importance for post-seismic response and tsumami alert purposes. When no local real-time data are available, which is today the case for most subduction earthquakes, the first information comes from teleseismic body waves. Standard body-wave methods give accurate magnitudes for earthquakes up to Mw= 7-7.5. For larger earthquakes, the analysis is more complex, because of the non-validity of the point-source approximation and of the interaction between direct and surface-reflected phases. The latter effect acts as a strong high-pass filter, which complicates the magnitude determination. We here propose an automated deconvolutive approach, which does not impose any simplifying assumptions about the rupture process, thus being well adapted to large earthquakes. We first determine the source duration based on the length of the high frequency (1-3Hz) signal content. The deconvolution of synthetic double-couple point source signals-depending on the four earthquake parameters strike, dip, rake and depth-from the windowed real data body-wave signals (including P, PcP, PP, SH and ScS waves) gives the apparent source time function (STF). We search the optimal combination of these four parameters that respects the physical features of any STF: causality, positivity and stability of the seismic moment at all stations. Once this combination is retrieved, the integration of the STFs gives directly the moment magnitude. We apply this new approach, referred as the SCARDEC method, to most of the major subduction earthquakes in the period 1990-2010. Magnitude differences between the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) and the SCARDEC method may reach 0.2, but values are found consistent if we take into account that the Global CMT solutions for large, shallow earthquakes suffer from a known trade-off between dip and seismic moment. We show by modelling long-period surface waves of these events that the source parameters retrieved using the SCARDEC method explain the observed surface waves as well as the Global CMT parameters, thus confirming the existing trade-off. For some well-instrumented earthquakes, our results are also supported by independent studies based on local geodetic or strong motion data. This study is mainly focused on moment determination. However, the SCARDEC method also informs us about the focal mechanism and source depth, and can be a starting point to study systematically the complexity of the STF. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).},

Applying the logic tree algorithm, resulting hazard values with error estimates are obtained as fractile curves (median, 16{\%} and 84{\%} fractiles and mean) plotted for pga (peak ground acceleration; median values for Cologne 0.7 and 1.2 m/s(2) for probabilities of exceedence of 10{\%} and 2{\%}, respectively, in 50 years), 0.4 s (0.8 and 1.5 m/s(2)) and 1.0 s (0.3 and 0.5 m/s(2)) pseudoacclerations, and intensity (I-0 = 6.5 and 7.2). For the ground motion parameters, rock foundation is assumed. For the area near Cologne and Aachen, maps show the median and 84{\%} fractile hazard for 2{\%} probability of exceedence in 50 years based on pga (maximum median value about 1.5 m/s(2)), and 0.4 s ({\textgreater} 2 m/s(2)) and 1.0 s (about 0.8 m/s(2)) pseudoaccelerations, all for rock. The pga 84{\%} fractile map also has a maximum value above 2 m/s(2) and shows similarities with the median map for 0.4 s.

Motivated by real data collected in South Sudan, we consider correlation coefficient estimation with singly truncated bivariate data. By considering a linear regression model in which a truncated variable is used as an explanatory variable, a consistent estimator for the regression slope can be obtained from the ordinary least squares method. A consistent estimator of the correlation coefficient is then obtained by multiplying the regression slope estimator by the variance ratio of the two variables. Results from two limited simulation studies confirm the validity and robustness of the proposed method.

abstract = {Due to the increased availability of measurements of various geophysical processes, a need has arisen for statistical methods suitable for the analysis of very large nonstationary spatial data sets. The nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) models are one of the latest and most popular Gaussian process-based models, which reduce computational complexity and memory storage. The Bayesian inference is based on the assumption of a parametric covariance function that is often assumed stationary or known. Given that NNGP models are sensitive in the stationary assumption in comparison to other reduction methods, there is a need to build nonstationary covariance functions within the NNGP models. However, the construction of a nonstationary covariance function and/or matrix may be computationally expensive by itself in the presence of big data. In this paper, we develop an efficient two-stage approach that deals with nonstationarity and the computational complexity in the presence of a big spatial data set. We propose a new low-cost data-driven tree-structured partitioning technique to divide the spatial region into distinct subregions. Given the partitions, we construct computationally efficient nonstationary covariance functions for NNGP models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through simulation experiments and an application to the global Total Ozone Matrix Spectrometer (TOMS) data set, in which the proposed approach performs well in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational complexity.},

abstract = {In this study, we propose a data-driven method using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) to select the most suitable earthquake ground motion model (GMM) for application in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). The standard deviation (sigma) of the GMM is an important parameter for PSHA and plays an important role in data-driven methods. The main advantage of the proposed procedure is to introduce the posterior sigma as the key quantity for objectively ranking different candidate models against a given earthquake ground motion dataset. In the context of the Bayesian statistical framework, sigma is then determined for a given GMM based on the observed ground motions and at the same time takes into account the misfit of the GMM predictions to the observed ground motions. This feature addresses issues associated with other ranking methods where in some cases a considerable bias between the GMM predictions and the observed ground motions is effectively ignored. On the contrary, the DIC considers the influence of these two factors together by ranking models more favorably when they are associated with smaller bias and the determined sigma is close to the actual variability of the ground motions in the region under study. We submit the DIC method of this study as a useful and objective method for evaluating the performance of a GMM to a given dataset. This has potentially important application for PSHA when using multiple GMMs and either logic tree or backbone approaches are required to handle epistemic uncertainty in an appropriate manner.},

This article first aims at presenting some new approaches and related implementations done in order to automatically provide broadband STFs with the SCARDEC method, both for moderate and very large earthquakes. The updated method has been applied to all earthquakes above magnitude 5.8 contained in the NEIC-PDE catalog since 1992, providing a new consistent catalog of source parameters associated with STFs. This represents today a large catalog (2782 events on 2014/12/31) that we plan to update on a regular basis. It is made available through a web interface whose functionalities are described here.},

abstract = {We analyze high-resolution ({\textgreater}103points/m2) terrestrial lidar surveys of the 4 April 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake rupture (Baja California, Mexico), collected at three sites 12-18 days after the event. Using point cloud-based tools in an immersive visualization environment, we quantify coseismic fault slip for hundreds of meters along strike and construct densely constrained along-strike slip distributions from measurements of offset landforms. Uncertainty bounds for each offset, determined empirically by repeatedly measuring offsets at each site sequentially, illuminate measurement uncertainties that are difficult to quantify in the field. These uncertainties are used to define length scales over which variability in slip distributions may be assumed to reflect either recognizable earthquake mechanisms or measurement noise. At two sites characterized by 2-3m of concentrated right-oblique slip, repeat measurements yield 2$\sigma$ uncertainties of ±11-12{\%}. Each site encompasses {\~{}}200m along strike, and a smoothed linear slip gradient satisfies all measurement distributions, implying along-fault strains of {\~{}}10-3. Conversely, the common practice of defining the slip curve by the local slip maxima distorts the curve, overestimates along-fault strain, and may overestimate actual fault slip by favoring measurements with large, positive, uncertainties. At a third site characterized by 1-2.5m of diffuse normal slip, repeat measurements of fault throw summed along fault-perpendicular profiles yield 2$\sigma$ uncertainties of ±17{\%}. Here, a low order polynomial fit through the measurement averages best approximates surface slip. However independent measurements of off-fault strain accommodated by hanging wall flexure suggest that over the {\~{}}200m length of this site, a linear interpolation through the average values for the slip maxima at either end of this site most accurately represents subsurface displacement. In aggregate, these datasets show that given uncertainties of greater than ±11{\%} (2$\sigma$), slip distributions over shorter scales are likely to be less uneven than those derived from a single set of field- or lidar-based measurements. This suggests that the relatively smooth slip curves we obtain over {\~{}}102m distances reflect real physical phenomena, whereas short wavelength variability over {\~{}}100-101m distances can be attributed to measurement uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A cumulative frequency-magnitude relation, the Gutenberg–Richter law, dominates the statistics of the occurrence of earthquakes. Although it is an empirical law, some authors have tried to give some physical meaning to its a and b parameters. Here, we recall some theoretical expressions for the probability of occurrence of an earthquake with magnitude M in terms of a and b values. A direct consequence of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the maximum entropy principle (MEP) is that a and b values can be expressed as a function of the mean magnitude of a seismic sequence over a certain area. We then introduce the definition of the Shannon entropy of earthquakes and show how it is related to the b value. In this way, we also give a physical interpretation to the b value: the negative logarithm of b is the entropy of the magnitude frequency of earthquake occurrence. An application of these concepts to two case studies, in particular to the recent seismic sequence in Abruzzi (central Italy; mainshock Mw 6.3, 6 April 2009 in L'Aquila) and to an older 1997 sequence (Umbria-Marche, central Italy; mainshock Mw 6.0, 26 September 1997 in Colfiorito), confirms their potential to help in understanding the physics of earthquakes. In particular, from the comparison of the two cases, a simple scheme of different regimes in succession is proposed in order to describe the dynamics of both sequences.},

The UT is a method for predicting means and covariances in nonlinear systems. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian-distributed) probability distribution. These samples can be scaled by an arbitrary constant. The method guarantees that the mean and covariance second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving the same performance as a second order truncated filter but without the need to calculate any Jacobians or Hessians. The impacts of scaling issues are illustrated by considering conversions from polar to Cartesian coordinates with large angular uncertainties.},

abstract = {This study used earthquake records from China to investigate comprehensively the correlation coefficients between various intensity measures (IMs), including peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, spectral acceleration, spectrum intensity, acceleration spectrum intensity, Arias intensity, cumulative absolute velocity, and significant duration. After collection of metadata information, 681 three-component ground-motion recordings with magnitudes of Mw 4.9–6.9 were carefully processed and extracted from the China National Strong-Motion Observation Network System dataset (2007–2015). The applicability of both the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA)-West2 ground-motion model (GMM) and of other GMMs was verified for different IMs, regarding the China dataset. Then, empirical correlation coefficients between different IMs were computed, considering the uncertainty due to the different sample sizes of the observational data using the bootstrap sampling method and Fisher z transformation. Finally, the median values of the correlation coefficients were fitted as a continuous function of the vibration period in the range of 0.01–10.0 s and compared with the results of similar studies developed for shallow crustal regions worldwide. The developed region-specific correlation coefficient prediction model yielded tendencies approximately like those reported in other studies. However, obvious differences were found in long-period ranges of amplitude-based IMs, cumulative effect IMs, and significant duration. These results suggest the necessity of using region-specific correlation coefficients for generalized IMs in China. The presented results and parametric models could be easily implemented in a generalized IM ground-motion selection method or a vector-based probability seismic hazard analysis procedure for China.},

abstract = {Ambient vibration techniques such as the H/V method may have the potential to significantly contribute to site effect evaluation, particularly in urban areas. Previous studies interpret the so-called Nakamura's technique in relation to the ellipticity ratio of Rayleigh waves, which, for a high enough impedance contrast, exhibits a pronounced peak close to the fundamental S -wave resonance frequency. Within the European SESAME project (Site EffectS assessment using AMbient Excitations) this interpretation has been tested through noise numerical simulation under well-controlled conditions in terms of source type and distribution and propagation structure. We will present simulations for a simple realistic site (one sedimentary layer over bedrock) characterized by a rather high impedance contrast and low quality factor. Careful H/V and array analysis on these noise synthetics allow an in-depth investigation of the link between H/V ratio peaks and the noise wavefield composition for the soil model considered here: (1) when sources are near (4 to 50 times the layer thickness) and surficial, H/V curves exhibit one single peak, while the array analysis shows that the wavefield is dominated by Rayleigh waves; (2) when sources are distant (more than 50 times the layer thickness) and located inside the sedimentary layer, two peaks show up on the H/V curve, while the array analysis indicates both Rayleigh waves and strong S head waves; the first peak is due to both fundamental Rayleigh waves and resonance of head S waves, the second is only due to the resonance of head S waves; (3) when sources are deep (located inside the bedrock), whatever their distance, H/V ratio exhibit peaks at the fundamental and harmonic resonance frequencies, while array analyses indicate only non-dispersive body waves; the H/V is thus simply due to multiple reflections of S waves within the layer. Therefore, considering that experimental H/V ratio (i.e. derived from actual noise measured in the field) exhibit in most cases only one peak, we conclude that H/V ratio is (1) mainly controlled by local surface sources, (2) mainly due to the ellipticity of the fundamental Rayleigh waves. Then the amplitude of H/V peak is not able to give a good estimate of site amplification factor. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {Spatially varying ground motion (SVGM) may have influence on certain civil engineering structures with spatially extended superstructure and/or substructures. Conditional simulation of spatially varying ground motion (CSSVGM) may be viewed from two different perspectives. Most procedures available in the literature neglect the spatial variability in auto-spectral density (ASD) and estimate the SVGM through cross-spectral density (CSD) which was computed using the empirical coherency models. This paper proposes a coherency model that accounts for the spatial variability of ASD. A framework has been developed for the CSSVGM, through the mapping of both proposed coherency model and ASD over the footprint of an array. Current framework (existing in the literature) accounts for only the phase variability of SVGM while proposed framework accounts for both phase and amplitude variability. Ground motion generated from both perspectives is then assessed with the data recorded over SMART1 and LSST arrays. For the purpose of assessment, a definition of target spectrum based on the direction of arrival is explored. The effect of choice of coherency model on the simulated spatially varying ground motion is investigated first. Spectra resulting from both the perspectives are assessed against the target spectrum. An attempt has been made to predict the SVGM for a future event using a coherency model calibrated against a past event and an estimate of ASD of the seed ground motion. Finally, the effect of form of ASD (of a seed ground motion) on SVGM simulated is investigated by considering the ASD in different forms. Simulating SVGM through the mapping of both coherency model and ASD seems to be more appropriate than through CSD.},

abstract = {Continuous time dynamic models are similar to popular discrete time models such as autoregressive cross-lagged models, but through use of stochastic differential equations can accurately account for differences in time intervals between measurements, and more parsimoniously specify complex dynamics. As such they offer powerful and flexible approaches to understand ongoing psychological processes and interventions, and allow for measurements to be taken a variable number of times, and at irregular intervals. However, limited developments have taken place regarding the use of continuous time models in a fully hierarchical context, in which all model parameters are allowed to vary over individuals. This has meant that questions regarding individual differences in parameters have had to rely on single-subject time series approaches, which require far more measurement occasions per individual. We present a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimating continuous time dynamic models, allowing for individual variation in all model parameters. We also describe an extension to the ctsem package for R, which interfaces to the Stan software and allows simple specification and fitting of such models. To demonstrate the approach, we use a subsample from the German socioeconomic panel and relate overall life satisfaction and satisfaction with health.},

abstract = {We estimate the ground motions produce by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake making use of the recently developed Song et al. (2008) source model that combines the available geodetic and seismic observations and recently constructed 3D geologic and seismic velocity models. Our estimates of the ground motions for the 1906 earthquake are consistent across five ground-motion modeling groups employing different wave propagation codes and simulation domains. The simulations successfully reproduce the main features of the Boatwright and Bundock (2005) ShakeMap, but tend to over predict the intensity of shaking by 0.1-0.5 modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) units. Velocity waveforms at sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area exhibit characteristics consistent with rupture directivity, local geologic conditions (e.g., sedimentary basins), and the large size of the event (e.g., durations of strong shaking lasting tens of seconds). We also compute ground motions for seven hypothetical scenarios rupturing the same extent of the northern San Andreas fault, considering three additional hypocenters and an additional, random distribution of slip. Rupture directivity exerts the strongest influence on the variations in shaking, although sedimentary basins do consistently contribute to the response in some locations, such as Santa Rosa, Livermore, and San Jose. These scenarios suggest that future large earthquakes on the northern San Andreas fault may subject the current San Francisco Bay urban area to stronger shaking than a repeat of the 1906 earthquake. Ruptures propagating southward towards San Francisco appear to expose more of the urban area to a given intensity level than do ruptures propagating northward.},

The significant duration predictive models are expressed in terms of magnitude, distance, and focal depth; this last variable is considered only for intraslab earthquakes. A total of 418 and 366 accelerograms obtained from 40 Mexican interplate and 23 intraslab earthquakes, respectively, are used. The applicability of the duration equation for subduction interplate events is restricted to moment magnitudes 5{\textless}Mw{\textless}8 and distances to the fault surface 17{\textless}R{\textless}400 km; for intraslab events, it is restricted to 5.2{\textless}Mw{\textless}8.2, 22{\textless}R{\textless}400 km, and focal depths 35{\textless}HD{\textless}75 km.

@article{Miller2015,
abstract = {The selection and scaling of earthquake ground motions is an important step in defining the seismic loads that will be applied to a structure during structural analysis, and serves as the interface between seismology and engineering. Recent research suggests that potential problems caused by ground motion scaling are due primarily to discrepancies in the shape of elastic response spectra between the ground motion to be scaled and the ‘target' ground motion desired. These discrepancies may result in the scaled ground motions causing different levels of structural response than the response that would be caused by (unscaled) ground motions naturally at the intensity level of interest. A method for detecting such scaling bias is proposed, based on selecting a suite of ground motion records that have been scaled to all have the same intensity level (where here intensity is measured by spectral acceleration at the structure's first-mode period). The structural responses associated with the records are plotted versus the records' scale factors. Trends between the two values quantify the extent to which record scaling is causing biased structural response. Example results obtained using this method suggest that records selected based on the ground motion parameter $\epsilon$ (or that otherwise account for the spectral shape implied by ) can be safely scaled without introducing any bias, whereas $\epsilon$ the records selected using other methods have biased structural responses when scaled.},

abstract = {Fault systems with stepovers and gaps along strike are ubiquitous in nature, and many modern earthquakes (e.g., 1992 Landers, 1999 Hector Mine, 2016 Kaikōura, and 2019 Ridgecrest) have shown that ruptures can readily propagate across some disconnections, while being halted by others. It is quite possible, however, that many faults that appear discontinuous at the surface are in fact connected at depth, facilitating throughgoing rup-ture, and potentially increasing earthquake size. The present work explores whether the mapped surface slip in an earthquake is indicative of the connectivity of the fault system at depth. If there is a signal of subsurface connectivity in the surface-slip pattern, then the connectivity of the system could potentially be inferred. Through 3D dynamic rupture modeling of faults with along-strike gaps of various depths, I explore whether the amplitude or the spatial distribution of slip after an earthquake could be used to diagnose fault connectivity at depth. I find that, in general, fault segments that are connected up to shallow depths of 1–2 km and are relatively long along strike compared to the seismogenic depth tend to have higher slip gradients at their edges than faults that are connected at greater depth, or that are disconnected to the bottom of the seismogenic zone. Systematic slip gradient differences at fault segment edges have been recorded in past earthquakes, giving hope that the modeled effect can be detected in many cases, even though mapped surface slip is affected by a number of different sources of heterogeneity. The results provide an alternative explanation for observations that stepovers that allow throughgoing rupture tend to have higher slip gradients than those at which rupture ter-minates: perhaps many such stepovers are connected at depth, which could persistently favor throughgoing rupture. There may be implications for interpretation of apparent fault discontinuities worldwide.},

abstract = {Theoretical and observational studies suggest that between-event variability in the median ground motions of larger (M ≥ 5) earthquakes is controlled primarily by the dynamic properties of the earthquake source, such as Brune-type stress drop. Analogous results remain equivocal for smaller events due to the lack of comprehensive and overlapping ground-motion and source-parameter datasets in this regime. Here, we investigate the relationship between peak ground acceleration (PGA) and dynamic stress drop for a new dataset of 5297 earthquakes that occurred in the San Francisco Bay area from 2002 through 2016. For each event, we measure PGA on horizontal-component channels of stations within 100 km and estimate stress drop from P-wave spectra recorded on vertical-component channels of the same stations. We then develop a nonparametric ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE) applicable for the moderate (M1–4) earthquakes in our study region, using a mixed-effects generalization of the Random Forest algorithm. We use the Random Forest GMPE to model the joint influence of magnitude, distance, and near-site effects on observed PGA. We observe a strong correlation between dynamic stress drop and the residual PGA of each event, with the events with higher-than-expected PGA associated with higher values of stress drop. The strength of this correlation increases as a function of magnitude but remains significant even for smaller magnitude events with corner frequencies that approach the observable bandwidth of the acceleration records. Mainshock events are characterized by systematically higher stress drop and PGA than aftershocks of equivalent magnitude. Coherent local variations in the distribution of dynamic stress drop provide observational constraints to support the future development of nonergodic GMPEs that account for variations in median stress drop at different source locations.},

abstract = {The M w 9.0 Tohoku-oki Japan earthquake produced approximately 2,000 ground motion recordings. We consider 1,238 three-component accelerograms corrected with component-specific low-cut filters. The recordings have rupture distances between 44 km and 1,000 km, time-averaged shear wave velocities of V S 30 = 90 m/s to 1,900 m/s, and usable response spectral periods of 0.01 sec to {\textgreater}10 sec. The data support the notion that the increase of ground motions with magnitude saturates at large magnitudes. High-frequency ground motions demonstrate faster attenuation with distance in backarc than in forearc regions, which is only captured by one of the four considered ground motion prediction equations for subduction earthquakes. Recordings within 100 km of the fault are used to estimate event terms, which are generally positive (indicating model underprediction) at short periods and zero or negative (overprediction) at long periods. We find site amplification to scale minimally with V S 30 at high frequencies, in contrast with other active tectonic regions, but to scale strongly with V S 30 at low frequencies.},

abstract = {Considering spatial correlation of multiple earthquake intensity measures (IMs) is of particular importance in loss assessment of spatially distributed assets. This subject has been investigated in previous studies under the assumption of isotropy. Considering the fact that the assumption of isotropy is not valid in general, the present study employs a non-separable covariance model based on latent dimensions method to investigate anisotropic properties of spatial correlations and cross-correlations of intra-event residuals of multiple earthquake IMs. This method leads to the generation of valid covariance matrix in order to model anisotropic spatially distributed multivariate random fields. Two sets of IMs are considered in this study; the first set consists of peak ground intensity values (acceleration, velocity, and displacement), and the second set consists of spectral accelerations at three different periods. Data of 10 earthquake events in California and Japan are utilized in this study to estimate parameters of marginal and cross-covariance models. Moreover, parameters of covariance model of regional site condition, which is considered as average shear wave velocity of top 30 m of soil profile (Vs30), are obtained in order to investigate the effect of local sited conditions on spatial correlations of IMs. It is shown that maximum range and anisotropy ratio of covariance models of intra-event residuals of IMs are correlated with those of Vs30 values. Also, it is observed that the anisotropy direction of residuals of IMs is consistent with anisotropy direction of Vs30 values. Finally, predictive models are proposed to obtain marginal and cross-covariance functions for different earthquake IMs considering anisotropy.},

abstract = {The selection and scaling of earthquake ground motions is an important step in defining the seismic loads that will be applied to a structure during structural analysis, and serves as the interface between seismology and engineering. Recent research suggests that potential problems caused by ground motion scaling are due primarily to discrepancies in the shape of elastic response spectra between the ground motion to be scaled and the ‘target' ground motion desired. These discrepancies may result in the scaled ground motions causing different levels of structural response than the response that would be caused by (unscaled) ground motions naturally at the intensity level of interest. A method for detecting such scaling bias is proposed, based on selecting a suite of ground motion records that have been scaled to all have the same intensity level (where here intensity is measured by spectral acceleration at the structure's first-mode period). The structural responses associated with the records are plotted versus the records' scale factors. Trends between the two values quantify the extent to which record scaling is causing biased structural response. Example results obtained using this method suggest that records selected based on the ground motion parameter $\epsilon$ (or that otherwise account for the spectral shape implied by ) can be safely scaled without introducing any bias, whereas $\epsilon$ the records selected using other methods have biased structural responses when scaled.},

We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions.

abstract = {The April 25, 1992, Petrolia earthquake (M s 7.1) occurred at the southern tip of the Cascadia subduction zone. This is the largest thrust earthquake ever recorded instrumentally in the Cascadia subduction zone. The earthquake was followed by two large strike‐slip aftershocks (both Ms 6.6). Moment release of each of the earthquakes is as follows: 4.0 × 1019 Nm in the first 10 s for the mainshock, 0.7 × 1019 Nm in the first 8 s for the first aftershock, and 0.9 × 1019 Nm in the first 2 s for the second aftershock. These indicate that the mainshock and each of the aftershocks may have different tectonic backgrounds. The best depth estimates of the mainshock and the two aftershocks are 14 km, 18 km, and 24 km, respectively. The slip direction of the mainshock is between N75°E and N80°E. This slip direction is not consistent with either the relative motion of the North American and Juan de Fuca plates (N60°E) or between the North American plate and the Gorda deformation zone (N40°E). It has been suggested that the North American‐Pacific plate motion is accommodated by right‐lateral slip on both the San Andreas and Maacama‐Rodgers Creek‐Hayward fault systems; the intervening block is the Humboldt plate. If we modify the relative motion of the southernmost Gorda deformation zone to conform with the seismicity trends and allow the Humboldt‐Pacific plate motion to be about half the total North American‐Pacific motion, then the Gorda deformation zone‐Humboldt relative motion matches the direction of the Petrolia slip vector. Also, the mixture of focal mechanisms in the two distinct aftershock clusters can be explained by motion between the Gorda deformation zone and Pacific plate and the Humboldt and North American plates. The Gorda deformation zone is subducting beneath the Humboldt plate in the Cape Mendocino area, and the Petrolia earthquake ruptured the entire subduction segment between the Gorda deformation zone and Humboldt plate.

This is particularly true of point pattern data (in which the primary data are the locations at which target species are found), but also true of gridded data, and of georeferenced samples from continuous spatial fields. We describe here the R package inlabru that builds on the widely used RINLA package to provide easier access to Bayesian inference from spatial point process, spatial count, gridded, and georeferenced data, using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA, Rue et al., 2009). The package provides methods for fitting spatial density surfaces and estimating abundance, as well as for plotting and prediction. It accommodates data that are points, counts, georeferenced samples, or distance sampling data.

abstract = {In this article, I propose a method for estimating the magnitude [Formula: see text] at which subduction megathrust earthquakes are expected to exhibit a break in magnitude scaling of both seismic source dimensions and earthquake ground motions. The methodology is demonstrated by applying it to 79 global subduction zones defined in the literature, including Cascadia. Breakpoint magnitude is estimated from seismogenic interface widths, empirical source scaling relations, and aspect ratios of physically unbounded earthquake ruptures and their uncertainties. The concept stems from the well-established observation that source-dimension and ground motion scaling decreases for shallow continental (primarily strike-slip) earthquakes when rupture exceeds the seismogenic width of the fault. Although a scaling break for megathrust earthquakes is difficult to observe empirically, all of the instrumentally recorded historical [Formula: see text] mega-earthquakes have occurred on subduction zones with [Formula: see text] (8.1–8.9), consistent with an observed break in source scaling relations derived from these same events. The breakpoint magnitudes derived in this study can be used to constrain the magnitude at which the scaling of ground motion is expected to decrease in subduction ground motion prediction equations.},

abstract = {Ground-motion models (GMMs) are widely used in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) to estimate the probability distributions of earthquake-induced ground-motion intensity measures (IMs) at a site, given an earthquake of a certain magnitude occurring at a nearby location. Accounting for spatial and cross-IM correlations in earthquake-induced ground motions has important implications on probabilistic seismic hazard and loss estimates. This study first develops a new Italian GMM with spatial correlation for 31 amplitude-related IMs, including peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and 5{\%}-damped elastic pseudo-spectral accelerations (PSAs) at 29 periods ranging from 0.01 to 4 seconds. The model estimation is performed through a recently developed one-stage nonlinear regression algorithm proposed by the authors, known as the Scoring estimation approach. In fact, current state-of-practice approaches estimate spatial correlation separately from the GMM estimation, resulting in inconsistent and statistically inefficient estimators of interevent and intraevent variances and parameters in the spatial correlation model. We test whether this affects the subsequent cross-IM correlation analysis. To this aim, based on the newly developed GMM, the empirical correlation coefficients from interevent and intraevent residuals are investigated. Finally, a set of analytical correlation models between the selected IMs are proposed. This is of special interest as several correlation models between different IMs have been calibrated and validated based on advanced GMMs and global datasets, lacking earthquakes in extensional regions; however, modeling the correlation between different IM types has not been adequately addressed by current, state-of-the-art GMMs and recent ground-motion records for Italy.},

Here I provide a brief history of multiple imputation and relevant software and highlight the contents of the contributions. Potential directions for the future of the software development is also provided.},

abstract = {We present the results of the regression analyses between Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) intensity and the spectral acceleration (SA) at 0.3, 1.0 and 2.0 s (SA03, SA10 and SA20). In Italy, the MCS scale is used to describe the level of ground shaking suffered by manufactures or perceived by the people, and it differs to some extent from the Mercalli Modified scale in use in other countries. We have assembled a new SA/MCS-intensity data set from the DBMI04 intensity database and the ITACA accelerometric data bank. The SA peak values are calculated in twoways—using the maximum among the two horizontal components, and using the geometrical mean among the two horizontal components. The regression analysis has been performed separately for the two kinds of data sets and for the three target periods. Since both peak ground parameters and intensities suffer of appreciable uncertainties, we have used the orthogonal distance regression technique. Also, tests designed to assess the robustness of the estimated coefficients have shown that single-line parametrizations for the regressions are sufficient to model the data within the model uncertainties. For the maximum horizontal component, SAxxhm, the new relations are IMCS = (1.24±0.33)+(2.47±0.18) log SA0.3shm,$\sigma$ = 0.53, IMCS = (3.12±0.16)+(2.05±0.11) log SA1.0shm,$\sigma$ = 0.36, IMCS = (4.31±0.10)+(2.00±0.10) log SA2.0shm,$\sigma$ = 0.29. For the geometrical mean SA, SAxxgm, the new relations are IMCS = (1.40±0.31)+(2.46±0.18) log SA0.3sgm,$\sigma$ = 0.53, IMCS = (3.25±0.16)+(2.08±0.12) log SA1.0sgm,$\sigma$ = 0.38, IMCS = (4.46±0.10)+(2.01±0.10) log SA2.0sgm,$\sigma$ = 0.30. Adoption of the geometric mean of the horizontal components, rather than their maximum value, results in a minor shift towards larger values of intensity for the same level of ground motion; this difference, however, is contained within the regression standard errors of the former. Comparisons carried out in various manners for earthquakes where both kinds of data (macroseismic and instrumental data) are available have shown the general effectiveness of the relations.},

abstract = {The relation between macroseismic intensity and ground shaking makes it possible to transform instrumental Ground Motion Parameters (GMPs) in macroseismic intensity and vice versa, and is therefore useful for making comparisons between estimates of seismic hazard determined in terms of GMPs and macroseismic intensity, and for other engineering and seismological applications. Empirical relationships between macroseismic intensity and different recorded GMPs for the Italian territory are presented in this paper. The coefficients are calibrated using a dataset of horizontal geometrical mean GMPs, i.e. peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, spectral acceleration at 0.2, 0.3, 1.0 and 2.0 s from the ITalian ACcelerometric Archive (ITACA; Luzi et al. in Italian Accelerometric Archive v3.0, Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Dipartimento della Protezione Civile Nazionale, 2019. https://doi.org/10.13127/itaca.3.0), and macroseismic intensity at Mercalli–Cancani–Sieberg (MCS) scale from the database DBMI15 (Locati et al. in Database Macrosismico Italiano (DBMI15), versione 2.0, Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), 2019. https://doi.org/10.13127/DBMI/DBMI15.2). A dataset is obtained that corresponds to 240 pairs of macroseismic intensity-GMPs from 67 Italian earthquakes in the time window 1972–2016 with moment magnitude ranging from 4.2 to 6.8 and macroseismic intensity in the range [2, 10–11]. The final dataset correlates strong motion stations and macroseismic intensity observations generally within 2 km from each other, and each association is manually validated through an expert judgement. The adopted functional form is non-linear, predicting macroseismic intensity as a function of LogGMPs and vice versa by performing separate regressions. The set of empirical conversion relationships GMP–IMCS–GMP and the associated standard deviations are compared with previous models. In order to verify the proposed model, a map in terms of PGA is obtained, starting from the PSHA in terms of intensities (Gomez Capera et al. in Bull Seismol Soc Am 100(4):614–1631, 2010. https://doi.org/10.1785/0120090212) and then using the empirical relationship here proposed in PGA, and compared with the National Italian seismic hazard map (Stucchi et al. in Bull Seismol Soc Am 101(4):1885–1911, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1785/0120100130).},

abstract = {We present the R package BASS as a tool for nonparametric regression. The primary focus of the package is fitting fully Bayesian adaptive spline surface (BASS) models and performing global sensitivity analyses of these models. The BASS framework is similar to that of Bayesian multivariate adaptive regression splines (BMARS) from Denison, Mallick, and Smith (1998), but with many added features. The software is built to efficiently handle significant amounts of data with many continuous or categorical predictors and with functional response. Under our Bayesian framework, most priors are automatic but these can be modified by the user to focus on parsimony and the avoidance of overfitting. If directed to do so, the software uses parallel tempering to improve the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) methods used to perform inference. We discuss the implementation of these features and present the performance of BASS in a number of analyses of simulated and real data.},

@article{Bommer2020,
abstract = {Capturing the center, the body, and the range of ground-motion predictions is an indispensable element of site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analyses (PSHAs), for which the logic tree is the ubiquitous tool in current practice. The criteria for selecting the ground-motion models (GMMs) used in such studies have generally been focused on their potential applicability to the region and site for which the PSHA is being conducted. However, except for applications within the few regions with abundant ground-motion databases, it will rarely be the case that GMMs can be identified, which are perfectly calibrated to the characteristics of the target study region in terms of source and path properties. A good match between the generic site amplification model within the GMM and the site-specific dynamic response characteristics is equally, if not more, unlikely. Consequently, adjustments are likely to be made to the selected GMMs to render them more applicable to the target region and site. Empirical adjustments for host-to-target-region source differences using local recordings are unlikely to be robust, unless these have been generated by earthquakes from a wide range of magnitudes. Empirical adjustments for site characteristics are impossible, unless there are recordings from the target site. Therefore, the preferred approach makes parametric adjustments to empirical GMMs, isolating each host-to-target difference to map the individual contributions to the epistemic uncertainty. For such an approach to be applied, the emphasis moves from selecting GMMs on the basis of their applicability to focusing on their amenability to being adjusted to the target region and site. An adaptable equation is characterized by well-constrained host-region source, path, and site characteristics and a functional form in which response spectral accelerations scale with source, path, and site characteristics in a manner similar to the scaling implicit in stochastic simulations based on Fourier amplitude spectra.},

abstract = {In this study, new prediction equations for significant duration (DS5–75 and DS5–95) are developed using an Iranian strong ground-motion database. The database includes 2228 records of 749 earthquakes with small to large magnitudes up to the year 2018. The functional form of the model is an additive natural logarithm of four predictor variables, namely moment magnitude (Mw), rupture distance (Rrup), time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m (VS30), and the style of faulting effect (Fm), which is considered as an indicator directly in the functional form for the first time. The proposed models can be used to estimate significant durations of earthquakes with moment magnitudes (Mw) from 4.5 to 7.6 and rupture distances of up to 200 km. The models are compared with four existing significant-duration prediction models. The results indicate proper agreement between the proposed models and the models that use the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center-Next Generation Attenuation-West2 Project (PEER-NGA West2) database (say PEER models). Based on the results, our proposed models indicate an increasing trend of significant duration with an increase in the rupture distance. However, unlike the PEER models, the rate of increase in significant duration is decreasing in our model.},

Various applications of these models often give rise to case-specific prior distributions for the parameter(s) describing how much the coefficients vary. In this work, we introduce a unified view of varying coefficients models, arguing for a way of specifying these prior distributions that are coherent across various applications, avoid overfitting and have a coherent interpretation. We do this by considering varying coefficients models as a flexible extension of the natural simpler model and capitalising on the recently proposed framework of penalized complexity (PC) priors. We illustrate our approach in two spatial examples where varying coefficient models are relevant.},

Compounding the issue, GMMs from other seismic regions exhibit a strong bias to the available Icelandic strong-motions, underpredicting in the near-fault and overpredicting in the far-field regions. In this study, we approach this issue by considering several GMMs that have either been used or recommended for PSHA in Iceland or have functional forms that satisfy the minimum requirements of GMMs used in PSHA. We recalibrate these GMMs to fit the Icelandic data in the context of the Bayesian statistical framework and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, where model inference is carried out using both non-informative and informative priors for selected model coefficients from the original GMMs. Moreover, we used a random effects model to partition the aleatory variability into inter-event and intra-event components. We show that the GMMs with informative priors for magnitude scaling and magnitude-distance scaling terms, not only capture the high near-fault amplitudes and rapid ground motion attenuation with distance, but also introduce a controlled saturation of large magnitude ground motions, which is consistent with observations in other interplate regions. In this study we also introduce a simple GMM, based on informative priors from a model for magnitude-dependent earthquake depth in the SISZ, that fully captures the salient characteristics of the recalibrated GMMs. The presented models thus form a suite of new, essentially hybrid, empirical GMMs that can be used with confidence in predicting PGA and PSA for Icelandic earthquakes, with particular implications for the reassessment of the seismic hazard of Iceland.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a random field model of sequential ground motions, which considers the spatial correlation between the mainshock and aftershock from a stochastic view. First, the correlation between the mainshock and aftershock under the physical “source–path–local site” mechanism is explained. Based on the mechanism, the point-source model, and uniform-isotropic-medium model, a random single-point model for sequential ground motion with eight basic parameters is presented. Second, the random field model is developed from the random single-point model. More than 1000 pairs of sequential ground motions are used to identify and analyze statistically the basic parameters in the model. Moreover, the probability distribution of each parameter is presented based on copula functions. The results show that the spatial correlations of sequential ground motions can be effectively simulated based on the proposed random field model. Furthermore, it is possible to realistically reproduce the attenuation and time lag of ground motions at a local site.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of depth- and Vs30-dependent parametric velocity and spatial correlation models to characterise shear-wave velocities within the geologic layers of the Canterbury New Zealand sedimentary basin. The models utilise data from 22 shear-wave velocity profiles of up to 2.5km depth, derived from surface wave analysis, juxtaposed with models which detail the three-dimensional structure of the geologic formations in the Canterbury sedimentary basin. Parametric velocity equations are presented for Fine Grained Sediments, Gravels, and Tertiary layer groupings. Spatial correlations were developed and applied to generate three-dimensional stochastic velocity perturbations. Dispersion curves for the stochastic models and observed velocity profiles show good agreement over a wide frequency range with the dispersion data underlying the velocity profiles used as input data, indicating that the parametric perturbed velocity profiles replicate the dispersion characteristics of the observed velocity profiles. Collectively, these models enable seismic velocities to be realistically represented for applications such as 3D ground motion and site response simulations.},

abstract = {The damping modification factors are utilized to alter the design spectral ordinates for constructions whose damping differs significantly from 5{\%}, this being the level that is routinely considered by most codes. Such factors are habitually evaluated after suites of historical inputs representing the local seismicity. However, such records may not be readily available, due either to moderate seismicity or to limited seismological network; in such cases, representative artificial accelerograms might be used instead. This paper proposes a methodology for establishing damping modification factors after artificial inputs generated to match the 5{\%} design spectra; this approach can be used for countries, regions or cities. The proposed methodology is based on performing dynamic analyses on underdamped and overdamped SDOF linear systems by using the aforementioned selected accelerograms. Although previous studies have highlighted the differences among factors generated after natural and artificial inputs, it has been observed that such discrepancies are mainly due to the longest significant (Trifunac) duration of the artificial accelerograms. Therefore, the artificial inputs are generated as their duration fits those of the available local strong motion records. An application to Colombia is presented; the results are compared with those for some available Colombian records. The sensitivity of the calculated factors to the soil type, period and seismic zone is investigated; matching expressions are provided. Such expressions are compared with the prescriptions of major design codes and with other studies. The suitability of the proposed formulation is further verified in an example on an isolated hospital building.},

abstract = {High-damping displacement spectra and corresponding damping reduction factors ( $\eta$) are important ingredients in seismic design and analysis of structures equipped with seismic protection systems, as well as in displacement-based design methodologies. In this study, we investigated $\eta$ factors for three types of earthquake characterizing seismic hazard in southwestern British Columbia, Canada: shallow crustal, deep inslab, and interface subduction. We used a large and comprehensive database including records from recent relevant earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku event. Our key observations were as follows: (1) there is negligible dependence of $\eta$ on soil class; (2) there is significant dependence of $\eta$ on the frequency content and duration of ground motions that characterize the different record types, and (3) $\eta$ is dependent on period, particularly for inslab events. Period-dependent equations were proposed to predict $\eta$ for damping ratios between 5{\%} and 30{\%} corresponding to the three event types.},

abstract = {Response spectrum damping modification factors are key components of displacement-based seismic design methods. This paper examines the period dependence of damping modification factors as a result of near-source forward directivity, basin-induced surface waves, and surficial soil response by using recorded ground motions from the Canterbury, New Zealand, earthquakes as examples. It is illustrated that spectral peaks in the 5{\%} damped response spectra have systematically different damping modification factors than those suggested by conventional empirical formulas; this is also supported by arguments based on forced vibration theory. Because source- and site-specific effects are increasingly being considered in the development of region- or site-specific design response spectra, this work illustrates the critical need to adequately consider adjustments to damping modification factors to ensure that displacement-based seismic design procedures remain consistent.},

abstract = {Spatial distribution of seismic intensity plays an important role in emergency response during and immediately after an earthquake. In this study, we propose a deep learning model to predict the seismic intensity based on only the observation records at the seismic stations in a surrounding area. The deep learning model is trained using the observation records at both the input and target stations, and no geological information is used. Once the model is developed, for example, using the data from a temporal seismic array, the model can spatially interpolate the seismic intensity from the sparse layout of the seismic stations. The model consists of long short-term memory cells, which are well-established neural network components for time series analysis. We used observed seismograms in 1996 through 2019 at the Kyoshin Network (K-NET) and Kiban–Kyoshin Network (KiK-net) stations located in the northeastern part of Japan. In our deep learning model, approximately 85{\%} of validation data is successfully classified into seismic intensity scales, which is better than adopting either the maximum or weighted average of the input data. We also apply the deep learning model to earthquake early warning (EEW). The model can predict the seismic intensity accurately and provides a long warning time. We concluded that our approach is a possible future solution for increasing the accuracy of EEW.},

abstract = {Correlation and smoothness are terms used to describe a wide variety of random quantities. In time, space, and many other domains, they both imply the same idea: quantities that occur closer together are more similar than those further apart. Two popular statistical models that represent this idea are basis-penalty smoothers (Wood in Texts in statistical science, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2017) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) (Lindgren et al. in J R Stat Soc Series B (Stat Methodol) 73(4):423–498, 2011). In this paper, we discuss how the SPDE can be interpreted as a smoothing penalty and can be fitted using the R package mgcv, allowing practitioners with existing knowledge of smoothing penalties to better understand the implementation and theory behind the SPDE approach.
